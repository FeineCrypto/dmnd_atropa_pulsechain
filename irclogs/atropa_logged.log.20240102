[18:59:03] <mariarahel> i think the Treasury Bill might be a little too high
[18:59:21] <mariarahel> open to discussion
[19:00:50] <mariarahel> can either pump something to boost exposure or hire someone for some task
[19:01:31] <mariarahel> i have artistry options
[19:01:39] <ogwebchef888> Oh nice
[19:01:48] <ogwebchef888> Pump 0x27a4f4db98798098748712f2317774F98cEc7ED5 with it
[19:02:36] <mariarahel> can that boost exposure ?
[19:02:45] <ogwebchef888> 100% look at what nba tm did

[19:03:07] <mariarahel> do you have a demographic reference ?
[19:03:18] <mariarahel> where it will boost
[19:03:42] <ogwebchef888> It's global not sure
[19:03:45] <mariarahel> it's not out of the question but i don't yet see any benefit
[19:04:00] <ogwebchef888> Hmm
[19:04:01] <mariarahel> the token represents something obnoxious
[19:04:29] <mariarahel> it has FOMO connotations though
[19:04:49] <ogwebchef888> FOMO is good
[19:05:32] <ogwebchef888> A1A is pretty good option as its heavily connected to Atropa and is a consistent liquidity providor
[19:05:44] <ogwebchef888> A1A/KYMATO
[19:05:53] <mariarahel> A1A is an option

[19:08:36] <ogwebchef888> We invite SD to discuss
[19:09:38] <mariarahel> my target for full health of the treasury bill is about $600k FDV currently
[19:10:25] <mariarahel> $400k my target for bottom line
[19:10:50] <mariarahel> remember that the treasury bill token is mintable
[19:11:10] <mariarahel> it is the only token i have released with an unlimited mint function
[19:11:44] <ogwebchef888> Has anyone minted it ? 
[19:11:52] <ogwebchef888> Not sure i've seen you mint it either
[19:12:42] <mariarahel> it has been minted, yes

[19:14:54] <ogwebchef888> Yeah I see that

Have been working on a contract for this since September and am finally happy with how it reacts to real world use.

[21:28:39] <mariarahel> question for your thoughts
[21:29:32] <mariarahel> say teddy bear sky rockets beyond my ethics limit & I have to sell a bunch and then lock the full proceeds of the sale into further liquidity
[21:29:47] <mariarahel> the price of the token drops say 15% but the proceeds only go into locked liquidity
[21:30:24] <mariarahel> how does it affect the numbers from an investor perspective ?
[21:30:37] <_surfacing8671> thats a tough one. 
[21:31:37] <mariarahel> I have about 10 trillion tokens worth of headroom where that could occur currently
[21:32:38] <mariarahel> if it were to do a 10x for example
[21:33:18] <SunnyDay> If the tokens end up in burned liquid, i think the community would back the motion 
[21:33:34] <mariarahel> i don't see it going further than that short term
[21:34:06] <mariarahel> 200 investors would probably get it to 10x
[21:35:47] <mariarahel> that's more or less my game plan since inception
