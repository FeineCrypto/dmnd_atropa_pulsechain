[02:17:48] <mariarahel> ya you can only own a %
[02:18:28] <mokin> do you think there is a certain price range to add LP to it??
[02:18:40] <mariarahel> it is possible for the bootis like functionality to be the first plugin
[02:18:58] <mariarahel> i can't make recommendations for that

[02:21:36] <mariarahel> it is possible for the plugin structure to come in immediately after i solve the clustering problem
[02:21:58] <mariarahel> i am presuming that there is exactly 1 correct way to do it
[02:23:11] <mariarahel> i am fairly certain that 1 method is one of the solutions i already have worked out
[02:23:52] <mariarahel> i might have something to clean up or change in the extant code that i haven't yet identified as well

[19:39:25] <mariarahel> I will be placing LP of 1 🌈 vs my supply of NoNukes on hand and then monitoring the leaderboard for top holder
[19:39:37] <mariarahel> whoever holds the top position for 5 minutes first gets to decide next steps
[19:40:02] <mariarahel> I will not initially be burning the LP
[19:40:55] <mariarahel> this token will have significant function when the layer 2 gaming functionality is created
[19:42:53] <mariarahel> first top holder at Day: 11 Hour: 15 Minute: 13 Second: 5 Is 574 With 0.88
[19:43:31] <mariarahel> calling time at minute 18
