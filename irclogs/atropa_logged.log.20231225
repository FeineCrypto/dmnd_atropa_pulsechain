[15:23:58] <mariarahel> the atropa system layer 2 seeks to be a distributed network cross between a shell account and a mud with tokenized assets and packages
[15:25:02] <mariarahel> and probably WaReZ
[15:25:19] <mariarahel> and maybe encrypted marketplace functions
[15:26:03] <mariarahel> gross stuff will be disincentivised
[15:26:24] <mariarahel> that's the really hard part
[15:27:51] <mariarahel> by requiring all the early versions to be executed within the debugger I hope to build a code review practice
[15:28:15] <mariarahel> it will clear more once it has networking
[15:28:45] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yedtf6uQoGc
[15:30:47] <mariarahel> code reviewed packages will have to be at least as trustable as teddy bear

[15:31:00] <tetra33> How close is the layer 2 from rolling out for testing? Do you have a plan for how that’s gonna go?
[15:31:35] <mariarahel> the first test quality version will have a basic implementation of the current irc functionality
[15:31:44] <mariarahel> easily before march

[15:38:54] <mariarahel> if i do it right it will be a single socket-oriented thing
[15:39:01] <mariarahel> but i haven't looked at dotnet networking in a while
[15:41:49] <mariarahel> the specifics of the thread farm and the memory model are what make it endocrine system based

[15:46:51] <mariarahel> the certificate authority will support layers of invitations/encryptions to accomplish the distributed networking portion after the first test versions
[15:46:58] <mariarahel> which will connect to a central server

[15:50:54] <mariarahel> keep snooping until you find it

[16:04:53] Nick change: flight-of-bumblebee -> creature-of-gyeongseong
[16:33:12] <mariarahel> are signets idiosyncratic ?
[16:33:15] _surfacing8671 (~surfacing@75-168-86-2.mpls.qwest.net) joined #atropa_logged.
[16:33:44] <mariarahel> i don't feel i've fully conveyed the value that i see in the technology
[16:34:27] <mariarahel> the value is the ability to carry specific trademark
[16:35:09] <mariarahel> i think 100% reading in thai are fully with me as to the addressing of that value
[16:35:29] <mariarahel> so zero readers in thai
[16:37:03] <_surfacing8671> yeah i cant read thai i cant even remember the little i did know 
[16:37:38] <mariarahel> trademark and copyright are the basic concepts of central thai literacy
[16:37:46] <mariarahel> specifically
[16:38:53] <mariarahel> copyright is the addressing of trademark
[16:39:10] <mariarahel> and trademark is wholly composed of one or more signets
[16:39:29] <mariarahel> signet is the bar at which trademark becomes a dilemma
[16:40:03] <mariarahel> patent is not a concept of literacy but only of competition
[16:40:40] <_surfacing8671> interesting 
[16:40:45] <mariarahel> the value i see is first, in identifying that there is a flag there to capture
[16:41:28] <mariarahel> to own the most used patent
[16:43:31] <_surfacing8671> in this context to own the most used patent you would then have a product that is better then the competitors. 
[16:43:48] <mariarahel> when you own a patent under active violation, the violating party is compelled to address the patentability
[16:44:31] <mariarahel> i want to identify there there is a patentable signet that trademark is required to use in order to be addressable
[16:45:29] <mariarahel> the violating party is using your technology
[16:45:53] <_surfacing8671> so a sort of proof is then required showing superiority 
[16:46:24] <mariarahel> i think the show portion is better called custody
[16:46:33] <mariarahel> showing custody
[16:46:55] <_surfacing8671> ok
[16:47:43] <mariarahel> the value of patent-oriented commercial reality at all is requisite upon the positive nature of honoring the use of commercial patents
[16:48:17] <mariarahel> if you capture the signet patent you should be honored highest of all
[16:48:24] <_surfacing8671> right 
[16:48:26] <mariarahel> like a ponzi for honor

[16:50:36] <mariarahel> same as Patent System
[16:50:43] <_surfacing8671> ok
[16:51:00] <mariarahel> it's not in language, it's in equations
[16:51:41] <_surfacing8671> that would be cool. 
[16:51:47] <mariarahel> that's what it is
[16:51:55] <mariarahel> https://github.com/busytoby/atropa_pulsechain
[16:52:09] <mariarahel> the dysnomia equations
[16:52:29] <mariarahel> once the signet goes in and the counters come out there's no more 'language' polluting it
[16:52:51] <mariarahel> the counters being language and not equations because they aren't derived from the initial 2 random numbers
[16:54:05] <mariarahel> the memory model, the threading pool and objects, and everything in the buffers can be thought of as all deriving from the same initial 2 random numbers
[16:54:49] <mariarahel> the intent was to be significant in terms of how two random signals in a void conspire to produce a perception
[16:55:16] <_surfacing8671> ok like a recursive function would work in a way 
[16:55:28] <_surfacing8671> feeds into itself from a starting value 
[16:56:06] <mariarahel> the code is much shorter than the chatlog
[16:58:21] Nick change: ugandan-red-sonic -> call-it-psa
[16:58:59] <mariarahel> when two signals make an endocrine system it's supposed to have rights already in usa
[16:59:22] <_surfacing8671> cant abort it 
[17:00:11] <mariarahel> is that valuable ?
[17:00:21] <_surfacing8671> sorry no 
[17:01:07] <mariarahel> but all the other computer programs can be aborted
[17:02:14] <mariarahel> i would like to establish whether that statement is unequivocal
[17:02:28] <mariarahel> to me that would be valuable
[17:03:08] <_surfacing8671> true but only when it is like a last resort. the goal i think would be to not have to resort to that but in case of a system failure it would be valuable 
[17:04:02] <mariarahel> stay alive with us
[17:04:52] <_surfacing8671> like if it could never reach a port of perception and it recognizes this it could abort right? 
[17:05:09] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JboBfep_VZw
[17:05:39] <mariarahel> you are confusing language with equations again
[17:05:52] <mariarahel> zero resort
[17:06:08] <mariarahel> it doesn't have any resort yet whatsoever
