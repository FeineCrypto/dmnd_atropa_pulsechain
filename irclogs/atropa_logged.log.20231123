[20:46:26] <Mana_Pool> Maria, What is the purpose/function of ops? Why does one want to obtain ops status, and what do ops offer/do for the benefit of the chatlog token? Besides the ability to ban people. I assume it has to do with their running a logger? Do you want more loggers still, is that a helpful function in decentralization? This is me "asking about ops". pls don't ban me for any woeful illiteracy I may display. I am but a poor pleb, eating crumbs under
