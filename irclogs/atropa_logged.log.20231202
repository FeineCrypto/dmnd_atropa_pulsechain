[18:05:55] <mariarahel> Super Bowl LVII tm & Olympic Games XXXIII tm tokens have been suggested
[18:06:11] <mariarahel> have to prove the tm first though
[18:06:45] <mariarahel> They Aren't Designed To Quit Like NBA
[18:09:28] <thurston> why/how is NBA is designed to quit?
[18:09:40] <mariarahel> by trademark
[18:10:56] <mariarahel> I think the Super Bowl trademark is Go
[18:11:09] <mariarahel> Designed To Go
[18:12:11] <mariarahel> I'm Allowed To Have The Trademark
[18:12:25] <mariarahel> But Tokenizing It Is Different
[18:12:42] <mariarahel> Go Is A Public Proof Oriented At The Audience Of The Meatpacking District In Copenhagen
[18:13:46] <thurston> what about the trademark makes it designed to quit? why is NBA trademark designed to quit, while superbowl would not be? something about the legal legitimacy of the TM?
[18:14:00] <mariarahel> do you know what trademark means ?
[18:14:09] <dezzen> Maria
[18:14:15] <dezzen> Wen new token i miss it 
[18:14:26] <mariarahel> which one ?
[18:15:12] <thurston> yes, i believe i understand what trademark means. or i thought i did. 
[18:15:15] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaKXzOMk4vE
[18:15:22] <mariarahel> potential trademark example

[18:22:18] <mariarahel> $ONES
[18:22:42] <thurston> that video didn't seem to have anything to do with trademarks
[18:24:04] <_surfacing8671> trademarks are everything. 
[18:25:12] <mariarahel> the penalty for violating trademarks is censure
[18:25:26] <thurston> ok then evertything literally has to do with trademarks. a video of anything. even/expecially a video not discussing trademarks
[18:26:22] <thurston> so what i'm gathering here is that the NBA trademark may be subject to censure, whereas Super Bowl migh not be
[18:26:33] <mariarahel> then don't quit
[18:26:37] <_surfacing8671> if it represents anything then yeah. 
[18:26:44] <_surfacing8671> we arnt
[18:27:22] <mariarahel> the debate can make them more valuable
[18:27:34] <mariarahel> as the trademark is maintained
[18:28:09] <mariarahel> loss of the trademark will make them less than worthless
[18:28:21] <mariarahel> it will make them offensive in the ecosystem's record
[18:29:37] <_surfacing8671> yeah yeah. will be getting more eyes on pulse soon enough.  
[18:30:59] <mariarahel> Trademark Go Does Not Encounter Defenses
[18:31:24] <mariarahel> So I Can't tm Tokenize Super Bowl LVII Yet
[18:31:52] <mariarahel> It Would Break LEGAL
[18:32:01] <_surfacing8671> no 
[18:32:02] <mariarahel> Buy LEGAL Instead
[18:32:40] <mariarahel> The Restrictions For The Atropa Ecosystem Maintaining The LEGAL Token Are Very Strict

[18:44:45] <_surfacing8671> no they suck i hate the syntax  
[18:45:50] <_surfacing8671> but they are very useful if set up correctly. its just a wierd way to collect data. have increment up and down for every transfer 
[18:51:24] <_surfacing8671> do you know how to calculate the value of a token on chain? 
[18:52:12] <mariarahel> get the stable coin count vs the token-of-value count from the primary stable lp 
[18:52:54] <mariarahel> i would not trust it for accounting practice though
[18:53:58] <mariarahel> i think the Olympics tm is "Strong"
[18:54:08] <_surfacing8671> yeah thats the problem im running into. theres no liquidity on this chain yet and its not super accurate. so its like im doing this halfway blind 
[18:54:52] <mariarahel> I imagine an individual or firm holds the tm on "Strong" that the Olympics depends on
[18:55:19] <_surfacing8671> cuz you can fetch anything with a subnet. nothing asynchronous 
[18:55:20] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeDXt1_xJaM
[18:55:23] <mariarahel> Probably EY
