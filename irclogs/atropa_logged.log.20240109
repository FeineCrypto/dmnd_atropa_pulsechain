[00:07:32] <mariarahel> the assets associated with the qing dao should always require proofs before they are acknowledged as investible

[00:19:54] <mariarahel> i bet yogi is already set up where he could log the liquidity burning tx and $8k buyins to cover the deployment in real time when we get there
[00:23:03] <mariarahel> if it's an on-going thing we could see BFF achieve more liquidity than FDV like Two

[00:23:58] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZEQjtOIkyE
[00:25:53] <mariarahel> having equal liquidity vs fdv means guarantee of deposit at the $8k price
[00:26:21] <mariarahel> although not LEGAL, since the nonukes contract is mintable one at a time
[00:26:47] <mariarahel> if there's no significant liquidity left on nonukes then it's successful at guarantee

[00:27:23] <mariarahel> and no liquidities are placed on qing dao tokens
[00:27:33] <Yogi> Can it ever go higher than 8k?

[00:29:22] <mariarahel> it will become too high of a loss for liquidity providers at some point
[00:29:29] <mariarahel> and then should be allowed to rise
[00:29:39] <mariarahel> if we keep the investments coming in
[00:30:27] <mariarahel> if there are 1000 people that want at least one whole token then it's impossible to keep it that low
[00:31:45] <mariarahel> low volatility is our best sales tactic for new persons on the chain
[00:32:23] <mariarahel> they want to see low volatility without loss and then a profit cycle where they may or may not miss out upon but not result in loss
[00:35:08] <mariarahel> if the other holders with 50 or more tokens join in on the small sales-to-provide-liquidity then i will consider a lower number than 93 for my target holding
[00:35:59] <mariarahel> i'm thinking literally that the buy-ins are monitored and on every 8k mark we invite top holders to sell 1 and place liquidity with 1 more wherever they like
[00:36:47] <mariarahel> i think the top holder numbers will drop at an acceptable rate and we can gain a lot of data during the process
[00:37:34] <mariarahel> the token can be a long term feature in the ecosystem
[00:40:44] <mariarahel> sell into what you want to provide liquidity with to pump it
[00:42:08] <mariarahel> i'm still learning how to successfully move things around to effectively pump
[00:42:21] <Guest13395> Pair it with little guy, they can be BFF

[13:51:18] <mariarahel> put in my order for TCEHY
[13:51:25] <mariarahel> 2693 shares at $36.20
[13:56:37] <mariarahel> we are targetting LP burns of BFF of 1 at a time paired and we will set the bar for what quality starting with teddy bear
[13:57:36] <mariarahel> when price hits $8k
[13:57:53] <mariarahel> the goal will be to have a very large number of small liquidity pools
[13:58:45] <mariarahel> this will make exit easy for those who wish to cash out as the liquidity grows but will make entry more gamelike
[13:59:13] <mariarahel> i expect the liquidity pairing process to take a total of 45-60 days
[13:59:35] <mariarahel> it could go much quicker if we see a lot of exposure
[13:59:49] <mariarahel> or it could go slower if someone with a lot of BFF decides to dump
[14:01:44] <mariarahel> i don't think there's any question that we have the bags to make it happen it's more the question of how many new wallets can we get in prior to hitting $8k and then how many guests can we entertain to make the investment at $8k worthwhile while the liquidity level is established to make the $8k price floor permanent
[14:02:34] <mariarahel> i am open to any discussion of pairings with the Liberty token at any time that could result in profit for anyone holding Liberty

[14:12:33] <mariarahel> That The Player
[14:12:39] <mariarahel> Immortal Reflection That The Play
[14:13:57] <mariarahel> I Understand There Might Be A Pupae-like Data Representation That Is Best To Use
[14:16:39] <mariarahel> i think the 5-piece data that is stored at the beginning of the block is a vanadium & the 2 data pieces that follow can be considered a Gallium & A Cobalt
[14:17:26] <mariarahel> the physical reflection
[14:19:03] <mariarahel> a silver & an arsenic have to come next
[14:19:45] <mariarahel> i am presuming the arsenic can be arbitrary created data
[14:20:18] <mariarahel> the silver is supposed to naturally define the arsenic it is looking at
[14:21:22] <mariarahel> the silver & the arsenic also have only shared state within the handshaked buffer
[14:21:58] <mariarahel> so the Mu on the Oracle probably has to go away
[14:22:24] <mariarahel> the dysnomia object will only be able to serialize data after it has connected to the network
[14:23:19] <mariarahel> if Mu goes away I can reduce the assembly operations set
[14:23:59] <mariarahel> maybe an 0x12 maximum
[14:25:24] <mariarahel> if i make it a library such that it always has to be configured from scratch after connected to a network then it's a better framework
[14:26:00] <mariarahel> all the configuration can happen from Apparition, even the actual data storage
[14:26:32] <mariarahel> if the dysnomia library only contains serialized data in buffers
[14:28:32] <mariarahel> still overshooting
[14:28:57] <mariarahel> i dunno how silver is best defined
[14:29:11] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI5Y42o-mlw
[14:29:41] <mariarahel> if i already store data at silver & arsenic then i won't get to gold

[16:39:31] <mariarahel> mocked up the block state a little more
[16:39:52] <mariarahel> the mu in the oracle will stay & will be made active upon establishment of the first local block
[16:42:12] <mariarahel> the dysnomia library serialization will be tared to an output and initially the block data will be split into 2 attached tare functions, one for only private key data and the other only for encrypted state data, initially the encrypted history of the chatlog messages
[16:43:11] <mariarahel> by default the way the key data file operates when new clients connect they will only receive encryption key for the upcoming data and any earlier messages will have to be received from some peer that is willing to send them
[16:44:24] <mariarahel> the block data files will be self-compatible and transferrable from one peer to another but they will report incompatibility if the local oracle mu has already been populated from any earlier attachment and block 0 creation

[18:15:48] <mariarahel> Everyone From The Dark Web Associated With Shitty English Band Glass Animals Can Fuck Off
[18:16:00] <patrickg7818> Maybe, depends why the token wants to eat the other token
[18:16:52] <mariarahel> I Hope You Get Arrested
[18:19:35] <ead11> Need to do the math for it but  if you have  a token that 10% of supply is in lp with another at 50%    the 10%  is at 1mil mc example with 100k$ between each token in pair if it were to pump 10% on 1mil mc is 110k$ roughly 10k$    exposure on the liquidity pool. 
[18:19:50] <ead11> Oh I wasn't suppose to send that yet  😅

[18:21:59] <ead11> You would see about 5%+ price movement on token 2 depending on where the liqudity started
[18:22:04] <mariarahel> Is It On The Level ?
[18:24:06] <mariarahel> i can see it through validation no problem
[18:24:24] <mariarahel> but i want blockchain entities that can eat each other
[18:25:56] <mariarahel> at a primitive level it will be able to validate keys & that for ex that an edible message occurred and was eliminated and the consumer host will not have record of the contents of the eaten chatlog message
[18:27:20] <mariarahel> some other host might still have the message data in addition to the keys
[18:28:17] <mariarahel> if keys are also consumed then the local blockchain will have a record implying the missing data but not carrying it

[18:49:32] <Slothman_> maria, have you thought of a potential NFT usecase? to broaden the scope of users? Something like a lock on tokens, that release periodically, almost in a vested sense 
[18:50:02] <mariarahel> only sharia compliant function models will be considered
[18:52:25] <pano> Do you mean you reject 2CC or the pairing, you're still holding around 14% of the token afaik.
[18:52:31] <Slothman_> I'm sure someone could brainstorm that model.
