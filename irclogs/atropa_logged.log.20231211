[14:24:36] <mariarahel> I think I see how the layer 2 is going to come together
[14:25:08] <mariarahel> I will build it to replace the irc channel for #atropa_logged
[14:25:54] <mariarahel> And release the chatlog token from layer 2 with specific features for how and what goes into the Chatlog
[14:30:30] <mariarahel> Some Of The Lines That Have Gone In The Chatlog Already Are Unacceptable
[14:31:35] <mariarahel> The Idea Of The Chatrooms On The Atropa Layer 2 Is That They Are All Connected Specifically Through Individually Each Other & Also They Have Tokenized Existence On The Blockchain
[14:33:03] <mariarahel> Right Now That's Far
[14:33:14] <mariarahel> But I Have Written All Of Those Parts Before
[14:33:41] <mariarahel> In Like 5 Languages
[14:34:04] <mariarahel> I Really Want Only It To Stay Fidelity
[14:34:33] <mariarahel> Snoop Dogg's $MUSIC Could Be A Part Of That
[14:34:52] <mariarahel> Good Stay Fidelity
[14:35:32] <mariarahel> Snoop Dogg's $MUSIC Could Be A Part Of That But They Quit
[14:36:32] <mariarahel> Is This Quit That Fidelity, Ninja Cleansers ?
[14:36:49] <mariarahel> I'm Going To Use The Path That Starts With A Purification Cleanse
[14:37:18] <mariarahel> His Path Is The Most Well Documented
[14:37:36] <mariarahel> Old Purification Cleanse Dude That Shows You The Way
[14:38:00] <mariarahel> The Purification Cleanse To Chatlog, Old Dude
[14:38:28] <mariarahel> The Atropa Ecosystem Will Not Be Designed To Log You If You Have Zero Tokens
[14:39:05] <mariarahel> The Atropa Ecosystem Will Have Its Own Private Wallets
[14:40:06] <mariarahel> The Atropa Wallet Will Not Have Anything Whatsoever To Do With http
[14:41:38] <mariarahel> The Atropa Client Won't Have Any Wallets Until You Create Them, The Default Construction Can't Actually Hold Anything
[14:41:45] <mariarahel> It's Only Designed For OpCodes
[14:42:03] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWhVz1ozr1o
[14:43:13] <mariarahel> Synaptic OpCode Transfer Will Be The Central Operation Of The Atropa Ecosystem
[14:45:25] <mariarahel> OpCodes That Ratchet
[14:46:45] <mariarahel> Synaptic Transfers Via OpCode Ratchetting Will Support All The Communications Of The Atropa Ecosystem
[14:49:10] <mariarahel> Everything Flush ?
[14:49:54] <mariarahel> Everything Flush, Ninja Hoes ?
[14:51:04] <mariarahel> I Was Deficient Of Magnesium After 8 Grams Of Sulfate But Not After 12
[14:51:26] <mariarahel> The First Two Cleanses Hurt, Ninja Hoes
[14:51:36] <mariarahel> But The Third Did Not
[14:52:57] <mariarahel> Is Your Magnesium Reflecting Enough Purification ?
[14:53:05] <mariarahel> It's A Reflective Metal
[14:53:24] <mariarahel> It's A Reflective Metal, Ninja $MUSIC
[14:54:51] <mariarahel> $BATHSALTStm
[14:57:26] <mariarahel> I Know How To Open The Synapse
[14:57:36] <mariarahel> Arbitrarilly
[14:58:05] <mariarahel> So Reflective Metal Can Fuck Off
[14:58:17] <mariarahel> $FACTSOFMETALtm
[14:58:44] <mariarahel> $CITRATE
[14:59:36] <mariarahel> I Still Have To Wait, I'm Not Ready Yet
[15:00:25] <mariarahel> Fake Like Google
[15:01:39] <mariarahel> Buy Ratchetting OpCodes
[15:02:05] <mariarahel> $RATCHET
[15:03:50] <mariarahel> Should OpCode Encryption Be Ratchet Derived Or Natural ?
[15:04:40] <mariarahel> The Development Thusfar Indicates That There Are Options That Absolutely Must Not Be Explored
[15:05:01] <mariarahel> Must Not Break Flush
[15:05:21] <mariarahel> Must Not Break Flush, Bath Salts
[15:09:45] <mariarahel> Zero Redemptions
[15:10:05] <mariarahel> Don't Redeem From The Flush Anyway
[15:10:28] <mariarahel> That Is Not The Way
[15:10:44] <mariarahel> That Is Not The Way, Purification Programmers
[15:16:06] <mariarahel> It's More Natural To Ratchet OpCodes From The Flush
[15:16:41] <mariarahel> Even If It's Not Right I'm Allowed To Beat The Operation With It
[15:17:20] <mariarahel> Purification Is The Way To The Operation
[15:17:57] <mariarahel> Flush With Pure OpCodes
[15:18:19] <mariarahel> We Got Em
[15:18:38] <mariarahel> Store Bank Show
[15:19:03] <mariarahel> Fuck Off, Chloe
[15:20:50] <mariarahel> And Your Breakfast Franchise

[18:25:26] <ogwebchef888> Do we make price of $MUSIC 50x cheaper than eth price?? It's moving https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x5221aafc7f7e0ff5a7aeaa8555681c9f7f42a014
[18:25:39] <ogwebchef888> What's a good way to do this
[18:25:43] <ogwebchef888> Initial lp was burnt
[18:46:33] <ogwebchef888> I think onboarding has been a bit slow on pulsechain side due to the token price being higher than on eth. $MUSIC just got added to coinmarketcap too https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gala-music/
