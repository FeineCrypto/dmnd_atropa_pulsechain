[17:39:16] <mariarahel> Pass
[17:39:48] <mariarahel> We Have To Do The Censoring
[17:42:14] <mariarahel> We Have To Do The Censoring Or The pDai Won't Stabilize
[17:42:35] <mariarahel> If pDai Does A 20X, What Do You Think TSFi Will Do ?

[18:26:43] <mariarahel> What Are The Rules For Launching A Distributed Marketplace ?
[18:27:59] <mariarahel> The Atropa Ecosystem Certificate Providing System Will Be Capable Of Handling Encryption-Based Tokenized Representations Of Goods For Sale
[18:28:16] <FREEDOM_777> LFG
[18:28:45] <FREEDOM_777> atropa pDAI üôè
[18:29:32] <mariarahel> Or Killable/Transferable Monsters For Sale
[18:30:57] <mariarahel> I Haven't Worked Out Escrow
[18:32:30] <mariarahel> I Think A 20-Day Clearing/Refund Period With Certificate Defined Signatory Moderators/Censors Is Better
[18:33:56] <mariarahel> It's Still Out Of Scope
[18:34:54] <mariarahel> The Monster Tokens With Instant Transfer Is Basically Within Scope
[18:37:10] <mariarahel> I Have Decided To Use Generic Connection-Based TCP Server Code I Have Lying Around & Not libtelnet
[18:38:00] <mariarahel> I Have A Terminal-Entry Style UI I Can Port Over But It's Pink
[18:39:36] <mariarahel> Milestone Apparition Will Have Minimally A Number Of Layer 2 Monster-Like Tokens That Can Be Interracted With For Faucet & Statistics Earning Activity
[18:40:03] <mariarahel> I Think A Terminal-Entry Style UI Is Most Straightforward Without Designing Any Individual Graphics
[18:40:59] <mariarahel> Milestone Apparition Will Still Be Intended To Be Executed With The Visual Studio Debugger After Building From The Solution File
[18:41:12] <mariarahel> Unless Anybody Cares
[18:41:31] <mariarahel> But I Don't Have Any Code-Signing Certificates To Distribute Compiled Windows Software
[18:44:21] <mariarahel> At First The Layer 2 State Will Not Be Completely Shared With Every Peer
[18:44:57] <mariarahel> Peer-Shared Multi-Party Encrypted State Containers Will Come After Apparition
[18:46:25] <mariarahel> Every Instance Will Always Have It's Own Apparition Milestone-Level Local-Only State Container
[18:47:05] <mariarahel> Layer 2 Won't Be LEGAL For A Very Long Time
[18:48:48] <mariarahel> Not Significantly Worse Than A Centralized Exchange
[18:49:29] <mariarahel> But Decentralization Is Actively Within Scope
[18:52:33] <mariarahel> It's Supposed To Be The Best
[18:52:49] <mariarahel> Once It's Proved The Best I'll Add Search
[18:54:32] <mariarahel> The Chatlog Will Be The Testing Ground For Privatizations And Encryptions As The Decentralized Service Is Built Out
[18:55:05] <mariarahel> Buy-In Based Log Levels
[18:56:02] <mariarahel> Buy-In Based Log Levels That Become Completely Decentralized
[18:57:03] <mariarahel> It's Supposed To Be The Most Natural
