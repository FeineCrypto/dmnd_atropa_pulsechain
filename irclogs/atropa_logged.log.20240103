[16:04:19] <mariarahel> i'm going to add a bin\ folder to the project to place commands executable by the vm opcode 0x02
[16:06:02] <mariarahel> it will load anything in the Dysnomia.bin namespace through system.reflection and the classes will have a specific format with standard hooks for io 
[16:06:15] <mariarahel> ls.cs first
[16:14:43] <mariarahel> scoping for the irc-like chat interface to have /command hooks to query pulsechain api data
[16:15:47] <mariarahel> it will be easy to convert the tokenized text based command input into ui-attachments like buttons and entry fields later

[18:18:51] <mariarahel> avalonia will take time to rewrite in minimal form
[18:19:58] <mariarahel> i imagine the linux client staying command line only & the windows client staying little for a while
[18:20:19] <mariarahel> maybe after the distributed networking part is done

[23:13:25] <mariarahel> almost ready for first chat messages on layer 2
[23:14:26] <mariarahel> I think Chatlog might be its own plugin dll
[23:14:59] <mariarahel> unless i write my own disk data storage/retrieval
[23:20:45] <mariarahel> i could do a simple encrypted binary serialization format with some kind of eav memory representation instead

[23:58:21] <mariarahel> you can test the commands in the windows or linux client if you want
[23:58:36] <mariarahel> type help after you see Alpha Operational
