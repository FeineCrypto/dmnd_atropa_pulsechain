[02:04:48] <_surfacing8671> i would like the chat to know that transaction work on your nonce, they go in a set order. if you have pending transaction it will prevent any other transactions going through. to fix this, you can send your self some tokens or non at all and when doing so increase you gas limit so that it surpasses all the other pending ones and it will go through and then cancel those pending transactions. you can also on metamask do the same 
[02:04:48] <_surfacing8671> ing and also set the nonce to that first pending transaction and you will get the same results. 
[02:06:18] <_surfacing8671> yes any geth clients can be set up to be an rpc server

[19:29:54] <mariarahel> which motion to the future appears most profitable ?
[19:30:29] <mariarahel> what risks are there ?
[19:30:39] <_surfacing8671> wallet. its self custodial 
[19:30:58] <_surfacing8671> that ranges on an individual basis i would say 
[19:31:25] <mariarahel> it's too hard a sell for me to anyone not already on pulsechain
[19:31:59] <_surfacing8671> that is very true. at least the current state of wallets. 
[19:32:25] <_surfacing8671> Abstracted Accounts that are here but more so on the horizon should help that out tho
[19:32:36] <mariarahel> what are those ?
[19:33:02] <_surfacing8671> smart contracts that act like an EOA wallet 
[19:33:26] <mariarahel> i have seen some of those
[19:33:41] <mariarahel> i don't see the usecase though
[19:33:47] <_surfacing8671> like you can use an EOA or metamask to use one or you can use a finger print to unlock one as well. 
[19:34:37] <_surfacing8671> so for instance you wouldnt need to approve things before transfer because that would be bundled into one transaction 
[19:35:27] <_surfacing8671> you can pay in whatever token for gas. and also sponsor first time users. but those are more of the selling points for normal people i guess you can say 
[19:35:44] <mariarahel> getting 99% of people from dollars to eth in their own wallet is too hard 
[19:36:34] <mariarahel> some of the technologies that go up seem to me more like playtesting opportunities than investments
[19:36:38] <_surfacing8671> this will help that out. you wouldnt need eth to do your first tx, we could supply that for them without controlling there wallet. 
[19:37:11] <mariarahel> my target is users who deposit, don't check again for days/months, and then want a profit
[19:37:18] <_surfacing8671> that is very true as well. this isnt that tho. this is more of a fundamental change on how we all interact with eth 
[19:37:45] <_surfacing8671> right. these can for example auto deposit your tokens into aave for intrest gains 
[19:39:05] <_surfacing8671> the EOA is very restricted on what it can do while interacting with the chain where smart contracts have a lot more leeway. like the wallet itself could facilitate and use a flashloan while your eoa wallet cannot. 
[19:39:29] <_surfacing8671> and you also dont have a pass phrase to lose and get hacked from 
[19:39:35] <mariarahel> that bar is impossible for brand new entry
[19:40:01] <_surfacing8671> not if it is all handled in the background out of sight of the user 
[19:40:44] <_surfacing8671> i crated an app that with one click would take a flashloan and loop assets on aave to create a leveraged long position. 
[19:41:20] <_surfacing8671> the user doesnt need to understand it but from the wallet open a decent long on a token that is available.

[19:49:31] <mariarahel> Same Group That Owns Lanvin
[19:53:05] <_surfacing8671> ill probably be making a wallet in the coming months ill keep you posted on that. onboarding and ease of use it is top priority. there are new advancements almost every other day regarding the AA so it can be hard to keep up with it all. it also takes an additional infrastructure that isnt on every chain to facilitate most of it so that is a drawback. But we will see how all that progresses in the new year. 
[19:53:51] <_surfacing8671> oh hey it could probably be facilitated by the atropa layer0 
[19:54:55] <mariarahel> i've looked at several ways to handle wallet stuff
[19:55:21] <mariarahel> probably need to install geth and use my own rpc to make it functional
[19:56:32] <_surfacing8671> or a bundler if trying to run an ERC-4337 account they are kinda similar 
[19:57:26] <_surfacing8671> https://github.com/etherspot/skandha
[20:01:04] <mariarahel> i can't tell how that is supposed to be used
[20:03:37] SunnyDay (~oftc-webi@2601:282:8981:2200:4c89:ee3d:5e48:d2c7) left irc: Remote host closed the connection
[20:03:41] <_surfacing8671> so it runs alongside a geth node in a way. and what happens is that it takes transactions from the erc-4337 and puts it into the memepool on the geth node. so to execute a transaction with the wallet you need a verified message to the wallet so that it knows that it should execute something. that message gets relayed through the entrypoint contract via the bundler. 
[20:04:14] <mariarahel> I Really Like Algeria
[20:04:18] <_surfacing8671> its like the middleman that bundles the transactions together and places it in the memepool
