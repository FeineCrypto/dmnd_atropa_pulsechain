[17:48:47] <mariarahel> I Might Package Up The Data Model Into A Plugin Called Basel
[17:50:24] <mariarahel> I Might Not Build In The Plugin Layer Until Later
[17:51:32] <mariarahel> I'd Like To Put The Network Layer In Soon
[18:15:37] <_surfacing8671> i still need to go through that code and figure it out. so many missions im on recently.  what would the network layer include? communication protocols? 
[18:18:15] <mariarahel> the first iterations will have ability to run as server or client and will only support handshaking for encryption & supporting a first go at irc-like chat service
[18:18:59] <mariarahel> once it's working i'll put up a running central server full time at twee.se
[18:19:23] <mariarahel> then figure out how to decentralize the encryption layers & support something more interesting
[18:19:54] <mariarahel> multiple mechanisms for supporting state-like blocks are expected along the way
[18:20:51] <_surfacing8671> ahhh got it. 
[18:21:41] <mariarahel> I plan to have a client maximum of 10 for the server
[18:21:55] <mariarahel> so it has to figure out how to decentralize itself to pass that number
[18:23:06] <_surfacing8671> would it be like a node structure. like a network of them. 
[18:25:15] <mariarahel> I think as clients connect they will have the option to declare server port & then each server will negotiate the clients in excess of the 10 limit to other servers
[18:26:58] <mariarahel> over time the client can build up a list of preferred and/or banned server peers and it will use those to initiate instead of going straight to twee.se
[18:27:58] <mariarahel> As the network gets busier, the global-communications packets will have to traverse more peers in order to reach them all
[18:28:56] <_surfacing8671> right. so it would be like a network of self hosting clients then. would each client then need to have the entire network downloaded? or would be verified via the next communication in line or something idk. 
[18:29:08] <mariarahel> Each client will know how many hops from twee.se it is, and everything posts to there and then distributes globally
[18:29:22] <_surfacing8671> ok 
[18:29:51] <mariarahel> the download data will always be specific between the client & their immediate server connection
[18:30:40] <mariarahel> I presume any group of clients spread in any way amongst the connection state can agree upon and share encrypted blocks private amongst themselves
[18:31:41] <mariarahel> Handshaking across a peer-connection-state network is the same as handshaking over tcp
[18:32:28] <mariarahel> it just has to be hard enough that the guaranteed-observeable handshake can't be cracked
[18:32:32] <_surfacing8671> right that would make sense. would this be like a IPFS kind of network but without the hosts needed to support it? 
[18:33:23] <mariarahel> only irc-like com channels is immediately in scope
[18:33:32] <_surfacing8671> i guess it would start out like atropa_logged without the need for the log bots 
[18:34:04] <mariarahel> i will add file advertisements & transfers into the support early on though
[18:34:22] <mariarahel> Maybe up to all the features of Soulseek
[18:34:50] <_surfacing8671> i love soulseek dam havent heard anyone mention that in a long time still use it today 
[18:35:40] <mariarahel> I can plan to support jukebox mode for $MUSIC
[18:36:24] <_surfacing8671> that would be tight
[18:53:41] <mariarahel> You should be able to sell your chatlog for Chatlog token by the first real alpha release
[18:55:47] <mariarahel> web3.py looks like the best way to handle a wallet even in c#
[18:56:47] <mariarahel> if I get web3.py working in c# I presume someone already has examples for doing pulsex swaps
[18:57:27] <_surfacing8671> i dont know web3.py havent learned python yet. 
[18:58:45] <ogwebchef888> I have used web3.py for simple pulsex swaps, can always have a cloudflare worker handle that and then create a medium for c# api
[19:00:03] <ogwebchef888> used web3.py to mint OTPF, FPMB and few others :-) 
[19:00:38] <mariarahel> keys and signing for the tx post should be more common knowledge
[19:00:44] <_surfacing8671> i always disliked py as it was new my senior year and just seemed inadequate as a language but more and more recently i realize that it is a pretty robust language. 
[19:00:56] <_surfacing8671> you can do those over rpc even 
[19:01:23] <mariarahel> $NOTYOURKEYStm
[19:01:49] <mariarahel> Whose Keys Are Dat B, Ninja Hoes ?
[19:02:35] <mariarahel> if i can generate my private key & i can convert that key into my 0x address
[19:02:41] <mariarahel> but i dunno how to sign and post tx
[19:02:59] <_surfacing8671> i can help with ethers.js 
[19:04:57] <mariarahel> do you have any code samples for the final httprequest post for a signed tx like for pulsex or even just regular token transfer ?
[19:05:33] <_surfacing8671> i can create one yeah 
[19:05:56] <mariarahel> i am using like this for scan:
[19:05:59] <mariarahel>         public static dynamic GetToken(string ContractAddress)
[19:05:59] <mariarahel>         {
[19:05:59] <mariarahel>             return GetURI(new Uri(String.Format("https://scan.pulsechain.com/api?module=token&action=getToken&contractaddress={0}&page=1&offset=100", ContractAddress)));
[19:05:59] <mariarahel>         }
[19:06:02] <_surfacing8671> do you want the final final http request or the code that generates it 
[19:06:17] <mariarahel> i only want the final uri
[19:06:42] <mariarahel> i don't have any examples for postdata
[19:06:53] <mariarahel> but uri + postdata is all i want
[19:10:34] <mariarahel> also looking for how the n-word phrases are converted to privkey
[19:28:32] <_surfacing8671> sorry it will take me a minute got pulled into a meeting 
[19:37:55] <mariarahel> I hope to have all that entry area nailed down by mid-january
