[22:36:10] <koss11[m]> This is a long one Maria, I have not watched it yet.  Published yesterday.

[22:42:00] <koss11[m]> Remember Maria, the words you state kind of reflect the chart.  Your continued progress definitely reflects the chart.  There are many avenues that people are using to watch what you say.  Your Mystique definitely is an equation.  Mystique drives price.  Progress drives chart.  Words drive chart.
[22:42:00] <koss11[m]> I guess what I am saying is:   Keep doing you!
