[02:06:11] <mariarahel> ballsy chan
[02:06:31] <kevin_> Maria, if we hit our target price for bff, how much is expected to be burned in LP from the top wallets? 
[02:06:42] <mariarahel> sec
[02:07:14] <mariarahel> looking at a minimum of 107 BFF
[02:07:52] <kevin_> burned from the 414 address other top wallets?
[02:07:57] <kevin_> or*
[02:08:06] <mariarahel> i can't estimate about the other wallets
[02:08:20] <mariarahel> if og turns on the bots the 107 number might go up
[02:08:56] <kevin_> no, but to determine if a top wallet is malicious or not, how much is expected of them to burn?
[02:09:05] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAIZcLbkto0&list=RDQMbxIUrGVlQio&start_radio=1
[02:09:10] <kevin_> as in, what's an acceptable ammount?
[02:09:51] <mariarahel> i imagine that number will be determined after my own wallet has burned and/or placed lp on about 40 BFF
[02:11:17] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVpEKT8mbhE
[02:11:54] <kevin_> so if we run a scenario really quick, lets say you place 2 bff's in lp with teddy initially at 8k. If the three top wallets decide to join, and they place 1 in lp with teddy as well and burn it, would that be achieving the morals of the atropa ecosystem?
[02:12:45] <mariarahel> i don't think morals is a good word to use
[02:12:59] <mariarahel> but that scenario might get things moving quicker than i personally have planned
[02:13:07] <kevin_> I assume the purpose of the atropa ecosystem is to ensure that victims are minimized when working under your terms, if we stabilize the price at a point thats higher than what everyone got in at, there are no losers.
[02:13:40] <mariarahel> correct, i primary goal is identification and minimization of worst case scenario
[02:14:07] <mariarahel> if we can literally remove the bottom after reaching $8k then that is a target goal
[02:14:42] <kevin_> Ok, so hypothetically, if there was someone out there with a lot of teddy for example but also a lot of bff, and they burned most of it, that would help with the process?
[02:15:27] <mariarahel> there are aguable mechanisms of burning and or/lp that would not be assistive as well
[02:15:32] <mariarahel> arguable
[02:15:49] <kevin_> I just want to say, if this is achieved, you have created something absolutely amazing in crypto and I hope that everyone who reads this fully understands its magnitude. 
[02:16:27] <mariarahel> we'll see when we get there
[02:17:00] <kevin_> Do you faith given the leaderboard?
[02:18:39] <mariarahel> if multiple addresses with more than 20 tokens need to liquidate before we have room to sell without going under $8k it could cause delays
[02:19:23] <mariarahel> but overall the numbers are pretty much inevitable
[02:19:33] <kevin_> And if the top wallets worked together to ensure that doesn't happen?
[02:19:45] <mariarahel> so far that is the case
[02:20:23] <mariarahel> the target is strong and our progress is above expectations
[02:20:45] <mariarahel> i like seeing the holders numbers go up
[02:21:05] <kevin_> Have you considered a laddered approach?
[02:21:08] <mariarahel> a massive number of smaller investors is the best way to make it happen
[02:21:16] <mariarahel> laddered how ?
[02:21:19] <kevin_> I guess you did actually
[02:21:39] <mariarahel> i'm only considering how to best accomplish the effort with my own holdings
[02:22:22] <mariarahel> overall the ecosystem is supposed to be driven by how i use my holdings to prove the potential without any regard whatsoever to what anyone else does
[02:22:30] <mariarahel> and without any automated trading on my part
[02:22:48] <kevin_> At a certain level, announcing to a BFF whale that they must provide lp and burn it
[02:23:11] <mariarahel> i think it is reasonable that the community could be engaged to do that
[02:23:24] <kevin_> And if someone has already?
[02:23:25] <mariarahel> or even to force someone out
[02:23:41] <mariarahel> has what exactly ?
[02:23:46] <kevin_> What would be an acceptable amount to burn to try and ensure stability?
[02:23:59] <mariarahel> at the moment i am not recommending it
[02:24:23] <kevin_> Why's that?
[02:24:40] <mariarahel> when we get to $8k, burning 1 BFF at a time to any non-mintable token with a strong & friendly outlook is going to result in the best outcome
[02:24:50] <mariarahel> right now we want to squeeze the liquidity pool small
[02:24:54] <mariarahel> so it goes up to $8k fast
[02:25:15] <mariarahel> but also so that when it gets to $8k initially any large sell will face a significant loss
[02:25:31] <kevin_> Ok, so someone may have messed that up by burning lp
[02:25:46] <mariarahel> i would consider it premature
[02:26:05] <mariarahel> https://scan.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeidn64pd2u525lmoipjl4nh3ooa2imd7huionjsdepdsphl5slfowy/#/token/0xE35A842eb1EDca4C710B6c1B1565cE7df13f5996?tab=holders
[02:26:17] <kevin_> And what if it was done to ensure they had enough assets on the other side of the LP?
[02:26:27] <mariarahel> on the first page we have a total of ~37BFF available in LP
[02:26:58] <kevin_> Because if we get to 8k initially it will take a very long time to sell into whichever liquid asset and then provide additional lp and burn it
[02:27:19] <mariarahel> if they are burning against their own token with a strong outlook and wholly friendly intentions and particularly if they have a small holding and want the burn to increase the value of their own token by burning BFF on liquidity, then that's great
[02:28:01] <kevin_> right
[02:28:41] <mariarahel> figure if you have a non-mintable token and you burn your BFF holding to LP against it but retain enough of your own token to buy back the BFF that you burned then that's exactly how the Atropa Ecosystem was launched itself
[02:28:54] <kevin_> because many do not have a lot of money outside of bff. Most of the whales hit big on this one except crazy robot guy, so they won't be able to burn liquidity with anything outside of what they profit from selling at 8k
[02:29:45] <kevin_> Thats very cool.
[02:30:37] <mariarahel> I would suggest looking into the LEGAL token and the burned LPs that extend out from it 
[02:31:16] <mariarahel> 0xDf6A16689A893095C721542e5d3CE55bBcc23aC6
[02:31:29] <mariarahel> We are doing the same as that contract with BFF if we fully meet the goal
[02:32:06] <mariarahel> except that the bottom-line guarantee of liquidity will be vs stable $
[02:32:40] <mariarahel> the assets that guarantee the bottom line of TWO are not stable
[02:33:30] <kevin_> Right, so overtime it simply moves with the market, kind of like the spy, while stabilizing the pstables.
[02:34:41] <ogwebchef888> here's txn of bot. open to thoughts on what buy amounts and time intervals is adequate https://scan.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeidn64pd2u525lmoipjl4nh3ooa2imd7huionjsdepdsphl5slfowy/#/tx/0x86165d32fcc19f50351f2933983dbfd0eb21f9c49a5bcc82bb78f62c0e126572
[02:36:17] <mariarahel> up to you, i wasn't sure i only recalled i started at 200
[02:36:36] <kevin_> Do you work alone maria?
[02:37:05] <kevin_> And was this all initially thought about by you?
[02:37:07] <mariarahel> i am encouraging anyone who wants to work under a single name as a team of writers
[02:37:25] <kevin_> noted.
[02:39:33] <kevin_> It must be difficult to understand something that could change the world for the better and not have others get it. 
[02:40:03] <mariarahel> it's computer science, you attack it one day at a time and it grows
[02:40:44] <kevin_> but with this computer science turns into world economies...
[02:41:07] <kevin_> This could change how the world views computer science forever.
[02:41:13] <mariarahel> quantifiably just robot stuff, from my perspective it only needs good architecting
[02:41:57] <mariarahel> after we meet goals on BFF a new challenge will replace it
[02:42:13] <kevin_> oh i'm sure you have plenty
[02:42:20] <mariarahel> not really
[02:42:27] <mariarahel> but something will come up
[02:42:53] <kevin_> But when you're doing this you're discovering things other's never get to.
[02:43:02] <mariarahel> keeping it wholistic 
[02:43:27] <mariarahel> ya, every uncrossed bar we can identify and meet is going to be a plus
[02:43:55] <mariarahel> it's always that
[02:44:18] <kevin_> Ok so what is the largest hurdle at the moment? Exposure to pulsechain?
[02:44:32] <mariarahel> moreso entry i think
[02:44:54] <kevin_> Probably because of the chatlog 
[02:45:07] <kevin_> And would you be ready for more exposure soon?
[02:45:24] <mariarahel> we are still in year 1 proving stage
[02:45:36] ead11 (uid622719@id-622719.helmsley.irccloud.com) joined #atropa_logged.
[02:46:05] <kevin_> right.
[02:46:12] <kevin_> But so far its going really well
[02:46:14] <mariarahel> i feel my position is ready for any level of exposure
[02:46:28] <mariarahel> but it is a holding position
[02:46:36] <mariarahel> and i covered all the bases
[02:46:45] <ogwebchef888> leaving it at this amount every 20 mins. i'll configure as needed or I see fit 
[02:46:46] <ogwebchef888> https://scan.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeidn64pd2u525lmoipjl4nh3ooa2imd7huionjsdepdsphl5slfowy/#/tx/0x5c0da40f66d435ea0840713fb1ca3d1ee273d4ae63eb3f7f1e33ea9eb5a537a8
[02:47:12] <mariarahel> every aspect of economics as i perceive it is reflected
[02:47:48] <ead11> Executing some ideas I've had been working on for a few months  see if I can do my part and start some fomo in the ecosystem 
[02:47:57] <ead11> Blockchain will display results 
[02:48:55] <kevin_> So then maria, how do you expect us to sell it? This is a very complicated subject and I assume you want to keep your anonymity. So how do you get the word out there?
[02:49:25] <mariarahel> i don't 
[02:50:02] <mariarahel> it meets all my requirements and qualifies in my perspective as the best investment prospect in crypto
[02:50:15] <kevin_> I'd definitely say so. 
[02:50:17] <mariarahel> so my presumption is people will buy
[02:50:34] <kevin_> might take a while though
[02:50:35] <ead11> I personally onboarded at least 1 person weekly for awhile  just 2 this week 
[02:50:49] <mariarahel> right, people do not know How to buy
[02:51:15] <mariarahel> and there is a massive campaign to keep them from knowing how
[02:51:35] <kevin_> Against richard heart?
[02:51:43] <mariarahel> against crypto
[02:51:58] <mariarahel> many projects have been malevolent
[02:52:19] <kevin_> So how can we prove that yours won't?
[02:52:28] <kevin_> Obviously your track record is clean
[02:52:30] <mariarahel> it's not possible
[02:52:35] <mariarahel> the whole network would have to crash
[02:52:38] <ead11> Pulsechain itself is harder to enter not atropa 
[02:53:12] <kevin_> Right
[02:53:31] <mariarahel> there is zero code technology, the mintable contracts have been made public knowledge, and i don't have any robots
[02:54:30] <kevin_> And you haven't sold down on any tokens besides penrose
[02:54:43] <kevin_> very cool to watch that by the way
[02:55:14] <mariarahel> i think it was a success, i'm very happy to see it has risen in price
[02:57:04] <kevin_> So if someone makes a lot on bff, would you prefer to see them stay in the atropa ecossytem or are you indifferent?
[02:57:23] <kevin_> Some may change their lives with what you're doing
[02:57:24] <mariarahel> it's not supposed to matter
[02:57:53] <mariarahel> i feel it's important to reward the earliest investors
[02:59:00] <kevin_> Would you consider rewarding the earliest investors that also ensured the health of the ecosystem by participating in the bff barbecue?
[02:59:29] <ead11> Penrose society has gained a bff more friends will join
[03:00:47] <mariarahel> lol
[03:00:57] <kevin_> Also, for the 666 tokens, are they intended to spread the atropa web as wide as possible to raise the floor in any way? I'm trying to understand the meaning behind their creation
[03:01:32] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHqfcepkzq8
[03:01:54] <mariarahel> are you familiar with word clearing in terms of scientology ?
[03:03:03] <kevin_> Lol
[03:03:10] <mariarahel> bad timing
[03:03:30] <mariarahel> it's not funny to not know about atrocities
[03:03:50] <kevin_> I don't see them as such
[03:03:59] <mariarahel> then you are not clearing the words
[03:04:18] <mariarahel> you are ignoring them
[03:05:05] <kevin_> right 
[03:05:14] <mariarahel> you are doing the world a disservice
[03:05:36] <kevin_> I'm not going to lie to you, i hadn't wrapped my head around this. 
[03:05:45] <kevin_> Especially with the cryptic words 
[03:05:58] <kevin_> But I agree, the world should know this exists

[03:16:23] <kevin_> A hostile takeover could occur from someone wanting to launch a project, and they advertise it as taking over a 414 666 token. It has the credence of being created by you but the responsibility of whoever's project took over

[05:25:47] <FREEDOM_777> ATROPA has been my favorite part of interacting on PulseChain. The people who I really appreciate in Pulsechain have all come from showing up to what's going on in atropa. I continue to believe in the potential of the the atropa ecosystem and the pStables and I enjoy learning what maria has to say. It's been a great journey so far and I'm grateful to witness it all.

[19:13:33] <candlekindle> I'll throw out a thought since nothing else has been put forth thus far. Those who contribute nonukes into the fund can be written into a 414 contract. Have 0 thoughts or suggestions pertaining to how that contract would function or it's place in the ecosystem. Ofc, the absolute best thing would be for people to simply just donate for the good of the project without seeking anything in return as I have done earlier. Was hoping to
[19:13:33] <candlekindle> see more of that, unfortunately that did not happen.

[21:40:04] <mariarahel> i think we're still currently above mark.. there might be points to address that could make it more attractive to smaller investors

[21:49:08] <Thursday_> Could you expand on how we can make it more attractive for smaller wallets?
[21:49:50] <mariarahel> one plan is to identify stuff in the way and knock it out
[21:50:28] <mariarahel> was the first russian oblast at sherman oaks california ?
[21:50:41] <Thursday_> Ok, from your observations, what seems to be in the way?
[21:50:47] <mariarahel> objectives
[21:51:16] <Thursday_> Being the 8k goal?
[21:51:44] <mariarahel> i think the objectives for the active bff investors is still not focused
[21:52:20] <Thursday_> So it's a lack of education
[21:52:58] <mariarahel> target practice has always won me friends
[21:53:37] <Thursday_> s there a local target price that you would like to hit in order to feel more confident in the current bff investors?
[21:53:49] <mariarahel> it's fuzzy
[21:54:04] <Thursday_> Like a teddy bear
[21:54:40] <mariarahel> immediately it seems to me to be what manx douglas learned from machiavelli & john calvin about touching bitches with cocaine
[21:55:23] <mariarahel> it's possible hussain started it
[21:55:34] <mariarahel> by putting lsd in their hair
[21:56:05] <mariarahel> he might have learned it in lapland

[21:58:44] <mariarahel> he invented the word School
[21:59:03] <Thursday_> I think the BFF community is fixated on the 8k price and likely won't pivot away from that objective it 
[21:59:03] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u97-chLYr3A
[21:59:33] <Thursday_> The largest issue seems to be the economic energy that's required for us to get there 
[21:59:40] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4kKIM72MuE
[22:00:01] <mariarahel> we have the funds, but we would like to reward more people

[22:02:12] <mariarahel> they napalmed him 
[22:02:17] <mariarahel> and they put out the napalm with grass
[22:02:23] <mariarahel> and that's where the peat came from

[22:04:02] <mariarahel> Herr Callixtus VIII
[22:05:28] <Thursday_> I see, so more smaller wallets at these prices so that all can benefit from the next leg up.
[22:05:55] <Thursday_> Do you have a specific # of holders in mind that we could reach for?
[22:05:56] <mariarahel> does anyone know the rate of new investors coming on chain ?
[22:07:30] <mariarahel> are there still hair care products with intoxicating amounts of LSD in them ?
[22:07:37] <mariarahel> on ebay ?
[22:08:07] <Thursday_> its probably very low. But you're right, this would be a spectacle that many should witness.
[22:10:23] <Thursday_> It will teach many about the benefits of the ecosystem.
[22:11:22] <mariarahel> i would be interested particularly to know the rate that new investors are coming on chain

[22:12:10] <candlekindle> First chart on https://apphex.win/chain/ displays Total Active Wallets, however, when you mouse over a particular day it states "New Wallets" as well. However, I don't know what they consider new to be. 
[22:13:14] <koss11[m]> I believe its up like 200k, I would have to research on X.     People have been tracking it.
[22:13:36] <mariarahel> i imagine the vast majority of that is automation systems

[22:35:54] <mariarahel> the danger is joinder
[22:36:16] <koss11[m]> he's pure evil, but you are correct as far as his approach.
