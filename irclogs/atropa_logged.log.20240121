[13:36:46] <naturaopals> ogwebchef888: what is your reasoning behind not allowing the tokens put into LPs to earn bff and no nukes? Seems it would discourage selling of the token. It would be interesting as well to have a token like yours, that also used a percentage of the tax to buy itself.
[13:58:02] <ogwebchef888> I think it makes sense to exempt lp contract addresses from earning reflections. Main reasoning is that those wallets are not really holders and allocations from what i've seen are not always distributed well when sent to lp address as it can have a conflict with arb bots.
[13:59:34] <ogwebchef888> Maximizes rewards to actual holders vs contract addresses
[13:59:50] <naturaopals> That makes sense. Wasn’t doubting you, just trying to learn/
[14:01:09] <ogwebchef888> i've also seen lp contracts can get skimmed but looks like its an exploit exclusive to self-reflecting tokens vs tokens that reflect other prc20s

[14:06:02] <naturaopals> Interesting.What is the negative of part of the tax buying itself?
[14:08:34] <ogwebchef888> Requiring high slippage is main one likely which can be remedied by setting a tax that is extremely low like 0.3% so this way it's not noticeable. will consider this if the thought is in demand in the future
[14:09:03] <ogwebchef888> would need 10x the volume to keep the rewards the same at that low tax though

[23:21:10] <ead11> I don't think it will be possible to reach 380$ for no nukes currently as the liquidity for leprosy is now at 30k$ x2 price drop will put it near 17k$  resulting in a negative price impact for no nukes still
[23:21:24] <mariarahel> gotcha
[23:22:08] <mariarahel> 633 is now top holder on 🌈
[23:22:20] <DadaCazazza23> I want Leprosy badly
[23:22:30] <mariarahel> oh, that's an lp pool
[23:22:36] <mariarahel> ead11 is still top holder
[23:22:52] <ead11> About 8% increase on no nukes price is good
[23:23:44] <mariarahel> clear options currently are burning the 🌈/Nonukes liquidity.. i'm of the opinion might as well, & buying up BFF with the bought back 22.915 NoNukes
[23:24:27] <mariarahel> i think i'm hearing hold steady here and don't do anything for a bit
[23:26:12] <mariarahel> i'm not sure if i have any good suggestion
[23:26:48] <mariarahel> i believe we will see some entry into the 3 new tokens
[23:27:25] <mariarahel> if the tm is valuable then the purchase is valuable
[23:27:27] <DunnyHex> Really?
[23:27:30] <DadaCazazza23> I would like 1% of Leprosy
[23:27:34] <mariarahel> and it will show also the value of LEGAL
[23:27:36] <DadaCazazza23> Thank You
[23:29:48] <mariarahel> i am open to offered DC a 1% amount of 🌈 off market at a fixed price if ead11 approves
