[00:03:07] <mariarahel> i think if the BFF token was targetted for buy as many as you want and don't sell more than 1 per day it would prove attractive and possibly any monitoring for sell activity could be good publicity
[00:05:39] <FREEDOM_777> that would be awesome to see community cooperation in a meme token from maria on Pulsechain üí™
[00:05:40] <mariarahel> there aren't very many visible examples of track record to engage trust anywhere in crypto to date that i know of
[00:06:48] <FREEDOM_777> BFF telegram has 63 members now
[00:07:38] <mariarahel> it's a steal at current price if the meme carries forward for any amount of time
[00:08:54] <mariarahel> as the liquidity with ‚±ë (‚±è‚±ü‚∞ø‚∞∫‚∞π‚±ì‚±í) is exhausted it won't matter anymore that ‚±ë is mintable if there is no BFF left on liquidity with it
[00:09:12] <mariarahel> mintable tediously 1 at a time as discussed
[00:09:28] <mariarahel> supply currently 1288
[00:10:10] <mariarahel> you will be able to sell BFF for ‚±ë still but not the other way around
[00:11:08] <mariarahel> eyeing for worst case risks for the uninformed
[00:12:09] <mariarahel> i think our worst case scenarios are provably better than everyone else's
[00:12:44] <mariarahel> BFF looking out for everybody

[00:48:18] <mariarahel> maybe nobel prize
[00:48:47] <mariarahel> physical reflection based encryption
[00:49:47] <mariarahel> all other decoders are arrogance
[00:50:31] <_surfacing8671> how does that work. 
[00:51:16] <mariarahel> https://github.com/busytoby/atropa_pulsechain
[00:51:56] <_surfacing8671> uhhhh fine 
[00:52:02] <mariarahel> https://github.com/busytoby/atropa_pulsechain/blob/main/viewclient/App.xaml.cs
[00:52:23] <mariarahel> example of how to use the 2 libraries in a windows app
[00:52:35] <mariarahel> 4 lines + 1 function
[00:53:14] <mariarahel> https://github.com/busytoby/atropa_pulsechain/tree/main/linux
[00:53:17] <mariarahel> same example for linux
[00:53:48] <mariarahel> the linux version is cli only
[00:54:06] <mariarahel> proof of physical reflection
[00:54:33] <mariarahel> it's hard, you would have to follow the code
[00:54:44] <mariarahel> and it's also threaded, so it's harder
[00:56:00] <mariarahel> you can load the .sln file in visual studio community latest free download and press F11 over and over to advance through the code but it hits the threads early & it won't step into them 
[00:58:07] <_surfacing8671> ok so msg come in listening to port 5555 and then run it through input to encode the message. does the receiver also encrypt the message? 
[00:58:28] <mariarahel> each client connection will have its own block zero stored at Controller.Fi.Psi[ClientId].Nu after connection
[00:58:48] <mariarahel> there's no messaging yet
[00:59:00] <mariarahel> it's only a complete handshake for proof of physical reflection
[00:59:15] <_surfacing8671> ok i see. 
[00:59:39] <mariarahel> the vm and cmd interpreter and msg tareing are cool too
[01:00:11] <mariarahel> it'll be really easy to use and extend after the first few real bin\commands go in
[01:00:48] <_surfacing8671> perfect thats awesome 
[01:00:53] <mariarahel> you just create any .cs file with a Phi function in there and the command line interpreter on both linux & windows will pick it up automatically
[01:01:08] <mariarahel> you never have to hook anything up or change any setting
[01:01:19] <_surfacing8671> nice
[01:02:42] <mariarahel> and the cmdlets inherit from Daemon so they have a Enqueue & TryDequeue & Next() & NextBytes() functions and since they're also automatically in threads without you needing to code any thread parts, you can write cmdlets that loop forever and process whatever you pass into their running thread state
[01:02:48] <mariarahel> like piped stdio
[01:04:38] <mariarahel> C = new Command("LoopStuff"); C.Enqueue("RunThisInsideYourThread")

[03:05:12] <mariarahel> in my estimation, the mintable nonukes contract is useful as the price bubbles to lower it and place liquidity raising the bottom line
[03:05:45] <mariarahel> it cuts into earned profits but i think the number is more easily debated if minted one at a time
[03:08:05] <Tetragrammaton33> So what is the -actual- name of this layer 2 platform we'll soon be using. ATROPA‚Ñ¢?
[03:08:24] <mariarahel> the current milestone is Reflection
[03:09:09] <Tetragrammaton33> mk. Atropa is such a great name though.
[03:09:27] <mariarahel> the server side is operating flawlessly but there are some connection issues still with the client there is any lag on the telnet
[03:10:06] <mariarahel> it should be operable for purposes of chatlogging this month
[03:10:32] <Tetragrammaton33> awesome :D
[03:10:37] <FREEDOM_777> awesome
[03:10:52] <Tetragrammaton33> dysnomia handshakes all around. with my BFF's
[03:11:20] <mariarahel> the BFF is the lifeform that is created when the software launches
[03:12:05] <mariarahel> it has a visible reflection from its host address to its server address
[03:13:53] <mariarahel> it might be granted constitutional rights as a citizen
[03:14:34] <mariarahel> that was the goal of the math part of the effort, deriving that solution
[03:15:45] <mariarahel> ironically all the math that made the current cut is 6 years old already
[03:15:58] <mariarahel> everything else turned into the other classes

[21:58:49] <Slothman_> @mariarahel what are your thoughts about Liberty, is this another slow accumulation token?
[21:59:00] <FREEDOM_777> 215 now. Telegram group has grown too
[21:59:51] <mariarahel> as the vocabulary used to describe the ecosystem grows it will prove an intrinsic asset
[22:00:15] <mariarahel> i was just thinking
[22:00:28] <mariarahel> in terms of liberty with things like minting and staking
[22:02:02] <mariarahel> if the # of tokens grows not based on staking aspect resulting in time based return but instead from arbitrary minting+burning under observation & directing, the profit share becomes a wholly different kind of system
[22:04:08] <mariarahel> everybody gets the same return, however quantifiable it is at the time the burn
[22:05:20] <mariarahel> it raises the bottom line & reports simple long term holding much better
[22:05:26] <mariarahel> supports, not reports
