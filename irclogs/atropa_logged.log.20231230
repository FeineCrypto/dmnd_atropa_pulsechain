[19:58:07] <mariarahel> i hope it will come together as one of those things you start using and it has like a whole new tactile feel for a software application
[19:58:36] <mariarahel> even from cmd line on linux as server only
[19:59:40] <mariarahel> the oracle will have unique encryption upon each launch but private keys will be added as stage one of the client code
[20:00:28] <mariarahel> the client will use the private keys to connect to one or more servers
[20:01:13] <mariarahel> also for specific activities like local encryption, it will be the same as connecting to a server
[20:01:41] <mariarahel> i'm still working out how to make those identical
[20:03:27] <ogwebchef888> Exciting =3
[20:04:03] <mariarahel> I don't have a good word to describe the collection

[20:05:16] <mariarahel> Domain\World\X where the X folder contains stuff like encryption, config, etc type stuff
[20:05:22] <mariarahel> maybe call it etc
[20:05:45] <mariarahel> Domain\World\etc\Crypto.cs
[20:06:46] <mariarahel> where the static Fi connects directly to the class to handle the cryptographic services
[20:07:40] <mariarahel> it could work out several ways.. i dunno

[20:16:19] <mariarahel> Methyl Is To TcpClient As Hydride Is To What ?
[20:17:19] <mariarahel> Is Hydride Rearrangement Fi Like Methyl Rearrangement Is Fi ?
[20:17:41] <mariarahel> i'm sure it is
[20:19:16] <mariarahel> maybe Psi is a class handling a collection of pluggables/unpluggables
[20:19:47] <mariarahel> Mu Methyl & Psi Hydride
[20:31:06] <mariarahel> the server & client tcp connections on the fi are distinguished at connection time locally by whether the connection is initiated as a cone or a rod
[20:34:49] <mariarahel> i guess i need to work in the private keys first
[20:35:08] <mariarahel> they'll have to use a class to save themselves to disk

[22:40:48] <mariarahel> need to sell about $400,000 worth
[22:41:55] <mariarahel> anybody wanna invest & support the dragon team ?
[22:43:05] <mariarahel> our progress towards a microservices architecture puts us in a well written position
[22:43:43] <ogwebchef888> Main rpc seems to be having issues

[22:43:59] <ogwebchef888> I'll invest for sure
[22:44:19] <mariarahel> if it goes over $15 i might sell some
[22:44:35] <mariarahel> unlikely to sell any of my bag before then

[22:47:14] <Robin__> @MariaRhael I also want to support and invest as before
[22:47:42] <mariarahel> TSFi is the target for supporting the concept of team
[22:48:27] <Robin__> now and in the future I like what you do and how you do it
[22:49:36] <mariarahel> if i can make the code base more attractive to set up a $400k investment, let me know how
[22:49:41] <Robin__> I already have TSFI almost from the beginning and I continue to accumulate
[22:50:55] <Robin__> and contributing LP
[22:51:33] <mariarahel> I hope everyone observing the chatlog particularly can turn a profit on that one
[22:52:43] <Tetragrammaton33> I'm glad you noticed pulsex is fucked up. The gas thing has barely been solved, it's still unusable with metamask
[22:52:49] <Robin__> Gracias de nuevo ;)
[22:53:09] <mariarahel> can any geth client be used as rpc server ?
[22:53:37] <mariarahel> and is it secure to just submit tx to any one ?
[22:53:40] <Tetragrammaton33> random question - does maria have a wallet host suggestion?
[22:53:54] <mariarahel> what do you mean wallet host ?
[22:56:58] <mariarahel> $400k is about all we're worth for software investment at the moment i think
[22:57:38] <mariarahel> you'll make a killing on fundraising round 2 when we get to it though

[23:00:31] <binky> I'd like to invest and support the dragon team
[23:00:34] binky (~oftc-webi@2604:3d09:cd78:1900:d585:90e8:33c7:3c39) left irc: 
[23:01:09] <mariarahel> if you can submit tx to any geth rpc securely then there are serious options for alternate ways to interract with the chain outside of mypinata.cloud ipfs websites
[23:02:20] <mariarahel> i 100% prefer a standalone open source app with zero html to all current wallet options
[23:03:12] <Tetragrammaton33> I mean like metamask alternative. Metamask isn't "the" wallet, i had a brief lapse on what to call it, haha. sorry
[23:03:49] <mariarahel> i only use metamask
[23:04:35] <Tetragrammaton33> interesting. well the iOS app was completely fucked with the gas estimations the other day. I couldn't even adjust it to get a tx to go through. had to switch to internet money
[23:05:35] <Tetragrammaton33> actually, one did go through and i double paid for something. Thankfully PulseLN was able to return it to me. great exchange for small sub $1k on/offboarding
[23:05:54] <Tetragrammaton33> https://archive.org/details/utriusquecosmima01flud/page/n51/mode/2up
[23:07:18] <mariarahel> if there are secure rpc commands that can be used with geth & it should be easy to put together a swap ui
[23:08:45] <Tetragrammaton33> i hope so. and i hope pulse figures out a way to keep gas estimations simple again. at first they were talking about some kind of bot attack, as to what caused it. The devs weren't saying much in the telegram
[23:09:05] <mariarahel> if it's open source and the codebase is tiny with few or zero 3rd party libraries i could consider using it
[23:10:11] <Tetragrammaton33> atropa UI is all I'm really excited for. I can figure out my swaps in the short term
[23:10:38] <mariarahel> do you already have python or js code ?
[23:12:29] <koss11[m]> <Tetragrammaton33> "interesting. well the iOS app..." <- Gas estimations were fucked not because of PulseX, it was on MM end.  Many examples of how to fix were posted on X.  ie:  change your custom gas limits.
[23:12:50] <Tetragrammaton33> my brother in satan i am not on that level of comprehension. I'm an electronic engineer lol. and not even a sophisticated one, i work with antique guitar amps/pedals
[23:13:22] <Tetragrammaton33> i'm barely keeping up with any of this. doing my damn best though
[23:14:40] <koss11[m]> https://twitter.com/yourfriendSOMMI/status/1741047391858684342
[23:14:46] <koss11[m]> its called read
[23:15:15] <mariarahel> should aggregate that stuff on #pulsechain
[23:16:01] <mariarahel> i bet it would be easier to curate a list of useful pulsechain comments 
[23:16:08] <koss11[m]> agreed
[23:16:17] <Tetragrammaton33> yeah i've seen all those threads, koss. There isn't an "advanced" menu in iOS, of course
[23:16:37] <mariarahel> i really like reference documents
[23:16:37] <Tetragrammaton33> everything iOS related is to make sure dumb dumbs can use it
[23:17:49] <Tetragrammaton33> koss he asked me about python, that's what i was responding to. i'm an expert troubleshooter, and i haven't got iOS MM to consistently work. i've tried tons of gas settings for different tx, nothing worked
[23:19:26] <Tetragrammaton33> literally i had dozens of small pending tx one day that never went through. then all of a sudden the biggest tx i made suddenly went through, from like a day ago. iOS mm is definitely not working like it's supposed to 
[23:20:26] <koss11[m]> then send the transaction hash to Bretep on twitter like he has asked.
[23:20:28] <Tetragrammaton33> never had any issues before 4 days ago
[23:20:42] <Tetragrammaton33> it;s all good - i'm just not using MM for now
[23:20:55] <Tetragrammaton33> IM is working fine and getting everything through
[23:21:05] <koss11[m]> No, fix your problem, send him the transaction hash
[23:22:45] <koss11[m]> https://twitter.com/bretep/status/1740437284888211457
[23:24:36] <Tetragrammaton33> i appreciate your passion friend. I'm good
[23:26:33] <koss11[m]> Nothing to do with passion, I have given you the solution - straight from the DEV's X account.  Up to you to handle it.
