[01:04:25] <mariarahel> magnesium glycinate tastes like awful

[01:24:46] <mariarahel> anybody wanna earn $100 bounty ?
[01:25:01] <ogwebchef888> LFG
[01:26:42] <_surfacing8671> sure
[01:27:40] <mariarahel> livinglikemike's request is a little harder than just verifying the contract as having zero or only a standard normal-form mint function
[01:28:05] <mariarahel> I think he wants the contract source codes verified on one of the scan systems
[01:28:30] <_surfacing8671> correct  
[01:28:58] <_surfacing8671> if it isnt verified almost right away it can be really hard to do so and can be very annoying  to get it done 
[01:29:14] <mariarahel> that is also my understanding
[01:30:04] <_surfacing8671> easiest way is to it with hardhat as you are deploying it but i mean it can be done just idk really hard to do so 
[01:30:15] <mariarahel> My idea more addresses heuristically verifying across everything
[01:30:57] <mariarahel> Someone should write an AV like analyser for contract binaries
[01:31:44] <_surfacing8671> there are some like sourcify i think. that finds similar contracts and assumes them. well the explorer or scanner does this as well. 
[01:33:23] <mariarahel> i'm sure with a high enough bounty someone can develop an acceptable solution
[01:34:02] <_surfacing8671> yeah sourcify is close but user needs to upload contract to ispf or something 
[01:35:42] <_surfacing8671> a simple not great solution would be to test against common abis say that it is at least this contract lol 
[01:41:00] <_surfacing8671> https://library.dedaub.com/pulsechain/address/0xd6c31ba0754c4383a41c0e9df042c62b5e918f6d/overview
[01:41:11] <_surfacing8671> here try that out pretty much verified 
[01:42:04] <_surfacing8671> you can even simulate the transaction 
[01:42:22] <ogwebchef888> Nice
[01:42:37] <ogwebchef888> The one im working on hasnt verified yet
[01:42:40] <mariarahel> I don't think many people have looked at how dOWN supports compound investment over Atropa
[01:43:44] <mariarahel> it might still be too early for that
[01:43:51] <_surfacing8671> i havent looked at that token to much 
[01:44:30] <mariarahel> I think we will see it become a profit leader around when Atropa hits 10-15 cents
[01:50:32] <mariarahel> If you want to buy into being an operator of the system, start by converting Atropa to dOWN
[01:52:04] <mariarahel> It is still very very early to buy into that

[02:00:46] <mariarahel> april fools day maybe
[02:11:27] <mariarahel> 4tblsp of magnesium glycinate over 12 hours might be safe
[02:12:02] <mariarahel> the bulk bag says 4/5tsp up to twice per day
[02:13:06] <mariarahel> maybe open a magnesium clinic when teddy bear hits 1billion

[14:18:04] <always-on-client> so far i haven't developed any ill will towards you, i just want to talk like gentlemen
[14:18:42] <_surfacing8671> schizophrenia is a hell of a drug 
[14:19:00] <always-on-client> ad homs already... interesting...
[14:19:13] <always-on-client> attack my character and not the issue at hand
[14:19:16] <always-on-client> sign of low EI
[14:19:22] <_surfacing8671> im the mad one here
[14:19:24] <always-on-client> not meant to be an insult, just an observation
[14:19:29] <always-on-client> are you sure tho
[14:19:38] <always-on-client> you seem bitter like you walked into someone else's business
[14:20:20] <always-on-client> if i remain calm you will eventually get mad because i'm not getting triggered enough
[14:20:24] <always-on-client> not worth it
[14:20:30] <always-on-client> i dont even want to fight with you 
[14:21:02] <ogwebchef888> Guys let's keep it diligent 
[14:21:15] <always-on-client> clean slate, we good _surfacing8671, no worries
[14:22:06] <ogwebchef888> I learned about ad hom in my critical thinking class
[14:22:12] <ogwebchef888> Modus Ponens is annoying af
[14:22:31] <ogwebchef888> Modus Tollens etc
[14:22:34] <ogwebchef888> Super confusing haha
[14:22:45] <always-on-client> lets just not pour fuel onto anymore fires
[14:22:56] <ogwebchef888> Agreed
[14:22:56] <always-on-client> i'm just expressing what i feel went wrong
[14:23:12] <always-on-client> this channel isnt being bridged right now so it's ok to talk openly
[14:23:15] <ogwebchef888> Yes and no harm in that. You are and will be heard imo
[14:23:16] <always-on-client> i'll delete the lines from mine later
[14:24:05] <always-on-client> i just hope you don't get rekt cause i played an innocuous prank
[14:24:17] <always-on-client> i obviously could have nuked all 3 channels if i was that bitter
[14:25:03] <ogwebchef888> All golden man. Webmastering and school keep me not rekt
[14:25:24] <always-on-client> exactly!!! working on this project was keeping me happy hitting flow state each day, then that stopped
[14:25:56] <always-on-client> passion + free work, what more could you ask for
[14:26:16] <ogwebchef888> Yes I remember you mentioned compounding work on work too 
[14:26:55] <always-on-client> there's a deep sadness that i haven't been able to shake since
[14:27:24] <ogwebchef888> Yeah that will make you Zero Cool quick
[14:28:06] <ogwebchef888> A lot of APTs root their chaos from deep sadness

[14:33:15] <always-on-client> i would encourage you to read Map of Consciousness by David R Hawkins, if you want love you can calibrate at it easily
[14:33:52] <always-on-client> if you think it's woowoo then ask why PBD brought it up 20 years later at turning point usa
[14:35:32] <always-on-client> i appreciate it tho _surfacing8671, will consume this after i finish waking up, since you took the time out of your day to suggest it to me, i will honor you by listening to it
[14:39:45] <ogwebchef888> track #18 is mad illn @always-on-client https://livemixtapes.com/mixtape/laws-your-future-favorite-rapper

[14:41:46] <ogwebchef888> 👍
[14:42:39] <ogwebchef888> yeah that dude got fucked big time, look into his mixtape "Yesterday's Future" he paid homage to Paul Mccartney and dude fucked him bad
[14:43:51] <ogwebchef888> Paul McCartney can fuck off
[14:43:57] <always-on-client> yikes
[14:45:33] <ogwebchef888> yeah disappeared after his label got sued for sampling stuff, legit if he would have not made that tribute tape he would still be around

[14:46:33] <always-on-client> that's fuckin dirty
[14:46:53] <ogwebchef888> Was a featured artist here, got close to blowing up with dude then he got targetted by the Palestinan hackers army, shit was trippy. Used to run dudes site and the server db got fucked
[14:47:11] <always-on-client> lol those guys drag net scan the internet
[14:47:16] <always-on-client> my wordpress got hacked by the israelis twice
[14:47:21] <always-on-client> decades ago

[15:02:05] <ogwebchef888> How does the biometric authentication work? Any specific method the primary one?
[15:02:51] <ogwebchef888> I know most airports filled with Iris scanners
[15:03:09] <ogwebchef888> do we know we are being biometrically authenticated ?

[15:13:46] <ogwebchef888> Main challenge with biometric authentication for digital banks is cybersecurity issues really, needs elite SecOps
[15:14:12] <_surfacing8671> i think that there is an erc for biometrics i know there are modules for it and using an abstracted account 
[15:14:56] <_surfacing8671> couldnt you steal fingerprint data and reproduce it tho? 
[15:15:29] <ogwebchef888> Yeah and we can clone voices these days too. Singularity prob wont fuck off if ever arrives

[16:21:15] <CoexistenceSteven_> 2
[16:21:19] <mariarahel> what's the log infinity ?
[16:21:39] <mariarahel> you need about $5m to buy in that far

[16:27:24] <mariarahel> fraud isn't going to pay enough
[16:28:11] <CoexistenceSteven_> Haha ok not me 
[16:28:16] <mariarahel> $5m can still buy you 2
[16:28:37] <CoexistenceSteven_> 2 what?
[16:28:56] <mariarahel> 2 everything as far as the chatlog is immediately concerned
[16:30:09] <CoexistenceSteven_> $5m can still buy you 2 of what 
[16:30:27] <mariarahel> I Don't Speak That Language
[16:30:43] <_surfacing8671> why KdV? im not the smartest when it comes to math and fluid dynamics but where do waves come into play here. 
[16:31:23] <mariarahel> the purpose of solving KdV again and again is to remind ourselves of the bar that everybody passes at the same level
[16:31:56] <mariarahel> the purpose of solving mKdV is to perform acrobatics until the bar is captured
[16:32:01] <mariarahel> then it's sKdV
[16:33:11] <mariarahel> the actual passage of the bar quantified to moment of passage is bolzano-weierstrass
[16:33:45] <CoexistenceSteven_> Ahhh
[16:34:14] <mariarahel> = ?
[16:34:33] <CoexistenceSteven_> $BEL

[16:35:19] <_surfacing8671> ok so that kinda makes sense 
[16:35:53] <mariarahel> if you keep it 100% KdV we'll get along really really well
