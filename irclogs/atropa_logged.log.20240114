[13:05:46] <mariarahel> Eric pointed out that instructions for creating your own tokens are not easily enough found in the chatlog
[13:06:04] <mariarahel> if you use http://remix.ethereum.org
[13:06:54] <mariarahel> to use Penrose as an example
[13:07:14] <mariarahel> this is the simplest token style with all the default features and non-mintable:
[13:07:32] <mariarahel> pragma solidity ^0.8.21;
[13:07:32] <mariarahel> import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

[13:07:32] <mariarahel> import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
[13:07:32] <mariarahel> import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
[13:07:34] <mariarahel> contract atropacoin is ERC20, ERC20Burnable, Ownable {
[13:07:34] <mariarahel> constructor() ERC20(/*name short=*/ unicode"The Penrose Society", /*symbol long=*/ unicode"PENROSE") {
[13:07:36] <mariarahel>         _mint(msg.sender, 666 * 10 ** decimals());
[13:07:36] <mariarahel>     }
[13:07:38] <mariarahel> }
[13:07:48] <mariarahel> that's the whole thing
[13:08:04] <mariarahel> my preference for long symbols & short names is noted
