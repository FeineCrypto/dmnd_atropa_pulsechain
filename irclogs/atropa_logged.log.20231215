[16:25:22] <mariarahel> I Am Thinking Of Calling The Next Milestone After Mesa As "Apparition"
[16:25:57] <mariarahel> Apparition Must Be Flush With Presence
[16:26:55] <mariarahel> Up For Debate Is Whether Presence Intrinsically Starts With Exactly Those
[16:27:16] <mariarahel> I Have Them, Niguh

[16:56:12] <mariarahel> And There Are 2 That Don't Get Counted
[16:57:13] <mariarahel> If The List Contains Comprehensively 25 + 2 Uncounted Members Then I Have Already Solved For Those
[16:58:10] <mariarahel> I Currently Understand That The List Is Exactly Correct
