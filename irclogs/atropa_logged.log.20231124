[00:01:45] <Charlotte> much love, @atropa. 
[00:03:27] <mariarahel> this is not a chat channel
[00:03:53] <Charlotte> ok. good to know. i'll stop chatting.
[00:04:26] <Charlotte> what is the purpose of it?
[00:05:44] <mariarahel> i am only able to read your communications as spam
[00:06:01] <mariarahel> are you aware of the urls for our chatlogs ?
[00:06:36] <mariarahel> i suggest this one https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7pqlcieu18lxd5h5z48d5/atropa_logged.log
[00:07:09] <Charlotte> ok. it's not intended to be spam. i am aware of the telegram, but you are unable to ask questions there. i thought this room was open for anyone with genuine questions.
[00:07:10] <mariarahel> i'm certain we have covered everything
[00:07:38] <mariarahel> you should move your general chatter to #pulsechain unless you have something to add that should be logged
[00:07:52] <Charlotte> ok. thank you, i appreciate that. 
[00:11:41] <mariarahel> i'm not sure that chatlog will have value without a more broad community on #pulsechain
[00:14:05] <Charlotte> I'm not sure what should or shouldn't be logged, because I'm unclear on many things that despite poring over the chatlogs I have found, I have not always been able to make sense of much of them. maybe the link you sent is a more complete log. 
[00:14:22] <mariarahel> as far as i can determine we're operationally complete at this point for what I have in mind
[00:16:46] <mariarahel> the bar is set where i want it.. so I can fuck off :)
[00:18:42] <Charlotte> you are operationally complete. so what is left for us on the sidelines is to research into the tokens, buy, lock liquidity, generally help the ecosystem grow. It's just such an interesting product suite, and many of us are quite bewildered and confused and are trying to decipher many things. but i will try to fuck off and trust that answers have sufficiently been given. enjoy your coffee and gym, and enjoy fucking off

[23:25:25] <alexander_as_helios> trying to decide on an ORM rn
[23:26:04] <mariarahel> Don't Get F= In Your Potential
[23:26:11] <mariarahel> Duh
[23:26:38] <_surfacing8671> vs is just easy to start with. i used to use eclipse 
[23:27:09] <mariarahel> no other development environment is nearly as easy as c# with wpf
[23:27:28] <mariarahel> i have looked at everything
[23:27:33] <mariarahel> except apple
[23:27:36] <mariarahel> no idea about apple
[23:28:37] <mariarahel> for cmd line programs some other ides are as good or better just because the debugger is cleaner ie jetbrains
[23:29:28] <mariarahel> it's easy to get unaccessable debug data in visual studio once you start mixing languages
[23:30:20] <mariarahel> xaml & resource tables alone makes c# and wpf best imop
[23:31:41] <_surfacing8671> really. ill have to check it out. i just saw today actually  
[23:31:43] <mariarahel> if you want to develop a single file exe gui app
[23:32:40] <mariarahel> Bottega Veneta Email Blast Just Now Is About Bullion8
[23:33:44] <mariarahel> Buy Some As A Gift !!
[23:33:51] <_surfacing8671> yeah but im running linux but if i wanted to make it for the masses 
[23:34:52] <mariarahel> ya, no real vs on linux
[23:35:10] <mariarahel> qt creator is pretty good
[23:35:29] <mariarahel> or vi & python & efl :)
[23:35:44] <alexander_as_helios> i have exp with qt5 from earlier this year
[23:37:01] <mariarahel> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QML
[23:37:14] <mariarahel> I am not a strong GUI guy
[23:38:03] <mariarahel> i've done just about everything with wpf though
[23:38:46] <mariarahel> dynamic xaml ui via telemetry is pretty easy
[23:39:12] <mariarahel> as long as i don't design it
[23:40:15] <mariarahel> dll loading & unloading is also really easy all around
[23:40:57] <mariarahel> i have that in mind down the road, the entire ui being dynamic via pluggable dlls
[23:41:20] <mariarahel> so the crypto layer just loads whatever skinned bullshit it wants for interraction with the chain

[23:45:56] <mariarahel> A Potential Equation Should Have A b In It
[23:48:35] <mariarahel> There's No Such Thing As Spring
[23:49:01] <mariarahel> Is This SpringX ?
[23:49:39] <mariarahel> Must We Ignore Every Pulse ?
[23:50:12] <mariarahel> Ignore Pulse & SpringX Like HRH
