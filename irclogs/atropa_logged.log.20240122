[15:59:59] <ead11> Less liqudity pools would need to be provided to have a greater effect  
[16:00:28] <mariarahel> i'm not sure
[16:00:30] <ead11> I would use ຮູງ໊ໄ  to aquire more ไมิติซส์  so when liquidity is added  it ends up being above nonukes/leprosy
[16:02:42] <ead11> That would make it the #2 liquidity for ไมิติซส์   
[16:02:59] <mariarahel> i could buy NoNukes up with Metis
[16:03:10] <mariarahel> and then sell leprosy for NoNukes again
[16:04:15] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUKcxc6-lDA
[16:04:43] <mariarahel> she invented leprosy
[16:05:04] <ead11> Correct and should be able to leave no nukes periodically at a lower impact       but you may only want to start buying metis after creating the liquidity so the lp carries leprosy
[16:05:37] <mariarahel> the other option is placing metis/leprosy liquidity and buying up metis
[16:05:46] <mariarahel> an other options

[16:13:44] <_surfacing8671> make a metis and leprosy pair and buy nonukes with leporsy 
[16:14:19] <mariarahel> i can place my entire metis supply on liquidity & burn, then do that if ead11 thinks that's the best option
[16:14:40] <mariarahel> it's good writing
[16:15:05] <DunnyHex> Lol
[16:15:30] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWZHmJX0jh8
[16:16:58] <_8DB> Thoughts ead11?
[16:17:06] <mariarahel> 155,174,233 Metis to 3 LEPROSY ?
[16:17:14] <mariarahel> $15k to $100k
[16:17:24] <mariarahel> it will cause a robot rush
[16:17:38] <mariarahel> that's how the zurich launch crash occurred
[16:18:06] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhVcb3wRgLo
[16:18:16] <_8DB> Isn't that something that we do not want?...
[16:18:35] <mariarahel> i am not sure
[16:18:48] <mariarahel> it rewards the active automated traders already on Metis
[16:19:05] <mariarahel> and since it is only tied to the one pool, it should not cause any wide crash
[16:19:19] <mariarahel> the zurich launch was set up that way on 5 or 6 tokens in rapid succession
[16:19:44] <_8DB> What's the impact long term?
[16:20:05] <mariarahel> i think open to debate
[16:20:42] <ead11> It works  I like it 
[16:21:02] <mariarahel> 15k to 100k ? i will place the liquidity right now and we can watch what happens :)
[16:21:38] <_surfacing8671> lfg! should be interesting keeping it tight on the one pair with no leaks 
[16:21:41] <mariarahel> v1 pool
[16:21:45] <mariarahel> i will burn after placing
[16:21:49] <ead11> It will work  approved 🔥
[16:21:55] <mariarahel> burn to metis
[16:22:07] <mariarahel> here goes
[16:22:09] <_8DB> what happens with small leprosy buys in this case?
[16:22:32] <mariarahel> we are about to see
[16:23:40] <_8DB> Yikes
[16:23:49] <mariarahel> LP burned
[16:23:57] <mariarahel> the prices have stabilized
[16:24:07] <mariarahel> metis is up 30%
[16:24:17] <mariarahel> 42%
[16:24:29] <_8DB> wow
[16:24:54] <_8DB> No nukes down 10%
[16:25:16] <_8DB> Leprosy 72% down
[16:26:36] <_8DB> good lesson
[16:27:00] <mariarahel> it is a vulnerability
[16:27:36] <_surfacing8671> now how much of the current supply was added for each token? 
[16:28:21] <mariarahel> each which token ?
[16:28:44] <_8DB> I just lost a lot of money but that was cool to understand
[16:29:08] <ead11> New lp is now worth 50k$ great
[16:29:09] <_surfacing8671> amount added to lp over circulating supply for each token
[16:29:50] <ead11> _8DB:  our new pair should be able to carry it effortless back to where it was 
[16:30:05] <mariarahel> 14% of Metis supply to 0.4% of LEPROSY supply
[16:30:35] <_surfacing8671> circulating supply not total supply.  
[16:30:38] <mariarahel> i can try buying NoNukes towards 380 again
[16:30:52] <mariarahel> we will see if there is more movement
[16:31:00] <_8DB> thank you for these lessons maria 
[16:31:02] <mariarahel> or wait
[16:32:12] <_8DB> Someone has taken the #2 Leprosy spot
[16:32:45] <_8DB> I'd wait Maria
[16:33:00] <_8DB> It will likely recover a bit
[16:33:09] <_8DB> But what do I know
[16:34:50] <mariarahel> i think we should sell 0.78 LEPROSY into NoNukes and see what movement there is

[16:37:12] <_8DB> Let's do it
[16:38:17] <ead11> Currently 36 nonukes in lp with leprosy   thats about 48% price impact still but new liquidity should counter act the sells
[16:41:19] <_8DB> interesting to see the impact that had on BFF
[16:41:24] <_8DB> wick to $2000
[16:45:12] <ead11> I wanted to use ຮູງ໊ໄ  to pump ไมิติซส์  when liquidity is made with leprosy so when bots pushed leprosy up could've skimmed on the  pump      still works this way 
[16:45:38] <ead11> As ไมิติซส์ should be able to to help leprosy in a positive way
[16:45:54] <mariarahel> let me check my stats on there
[16:46:40] <ead11> Still doable since there is about 2.5 paired to leprosy
[16:47:38] <_8DB> feels like I have Leprosy right now
[16:48:52] <mariarahel> between the tether & monat pools i have about 200m GAI to work with
[16:49:20] <mariarahel> about $5k
[16:50:00] <mariarahel> the holdings are very low on that one
[16:50:25] <mariarahel> about 90% of supply is in burned liquidity
[16:50:58] <_8DB> what's the CA? Sorry, I forgot which ones GAI
[16:51:07] <mariarahel> 0xd6077A029Fb5BEF33b02391D7f0349c345F6DDb1
[16:51:37] <mariarahel> to buy back to GAI i have to go THETA->CROWS->Monat->GAI
[16:52:53] <_8DB> Now I see why it's attractive to be a top holder in either of those
[16:53:37] <mariarahel> i have about $2k of monat on hand
[16:54:56] <mariarahel> i am interested to see what effect the sale of 0.78 LEPROSY into NoNukes would have on Metis
[16:55:38] <_8DB> well I just bought more Leprosy but why not!
[16:56:47] <mariarahel> 0x7FB09EE1a2c0E8b6D1c4E19C0248B3CbC0113af6 could be a good one to look at
[16:57:16] <ead11> I think in the future selling leprosy to metis and aquire more no nukes from there would be viable considering the routes in hand

[17:07:37] <_8DB> what a hoe

[17:08:30] <_8DB> respect the BUMP
[17:09:43] <mariarahel> burned

[17:11:37] <mariarahel> pigs
[17:13:33] <_8DB> pigs with Leprosy 
[17:14:16] <SunnyDay> Cocaine Pig?
[17:14:41] <_8DB> is all the lp in 0x7FB09EE1a2c0E8b6D1c4E19C0248B3CbC0113af6 burned?
[17:14:57] <SunnyDay> https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T2/images/I/51cI-nRWP4L.jpg
[17:16:01] <mariarahel> the majority is
[17:17:37] <_8DB> so can you help me understand if this is accurate: tokens with burned lp which you also hold a lot of could be subject to an event like what has just occurred with Leprosy/Metis?
[17:19:15] <mariarahel> the vulnerability is specific to new token launches and instances where the deployer holds majority supply, if liquidities are placed with disparate implied values then chaos ensues as the robots try to stabilize the price
[17:19:51] <mariarahel> even if the intention is only to reward holders of specific tokens with preferential buy-in during the new launch
[17:20:29] <_8DB> right
[17:20:40] <mariarahel> we saw just now the chaos at $15k
[17:20:44] <_8DB> So basically ead11 and I failed to see the vulnerability 
[17:21:00] <mariarahel> the zurich launch i think was around 20x that
[17:21:27] <mariarahel> i no longer hold any positions that large that could cause the vulnerability
[17:21:38] <_8DB> Wasn't the liberty launch similar as well?
[17:21:41] <mariarahel> i would completely destroy my position
[17:22:24] <mariarahel> the liberty launch was sold down from a high number so the very first buyers did not see preferential buy-in but a portion of loss
[17:22:31] <mariarahel> the number was not terribly high
[17:22:38] <_8DB> 17k
[17:22:43] <_8DB> #neverforget
[17:22:58] <mariarahel> for the token, but not for the buyers
[17:23:11] <mariarahel> we are in a similar position with LEPROSY
[17:23:51] <_8DB> Except there's a huge vulnerability with Leprosy with you holding that much
[17:23:52] <mariarahel> i think the losses during liberty launch were at worst in the 3 figure range
[17:24:03] <mariarahel> low 3 figures
[17:24:42] <mariarahel> correct, establishing launch capacity that reduces that vulnerability is a target
[17:25:04] <mariarahel> but we also want to keep the price high on this one due to the future roadmap
[17:25:31] <_8DB> There's a future for Leprosy?
[17:25:36] <mariarahel> i see its future utility similar to the most rare magic:the gathering type card
[17:26:03] <_8DB> So you could give your opponent leprosy in the game?
[17:26:17] <mariarahel> something like that
[17:26:44] <_8DB> cool, probably out of scope for now
[17:27:35] <mariarahel> ya, i am considering a number of initial features based on holdings of signing-proved not-spend-capable wallet-type connection
[17:27:58] <mariarahel> more or less still very out of scope though
[17:28:30] <mariarahel> no privkeys
[17:29:47] <mariarahel> the first in-scope feature will be a chat only for verified addresses
[17:30:04] <_8DB> I took your advice on 0x7FB09EE1a2c0E8b6D1c4E19C0248B3CbC0113af6
[17:30:08] <_8DB> please don't hurt me
[17:31:18] <mariarahel> i think we've probably hit a good target for the morning
[17:31:29] <mariarahel> maybe consider more moves after the lunch mtg
[17:34:24] <mariarahel> https://scan.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeidn64pd2u525lmoipjl4nh3ooa2imd7huionjsdepdsphl5slfowy/#/address/0x7a20189B297343CF26d8548764b04891f37F3414
[17:34:40] <mariarahel> only made 10 or so transactions this morning if anyone wants to see exactly what occurred
[17:37:41] <ead11> The new liquidity holding 50k$ is nice   the others are about 30-50k$ as well and nonukes the smallest at 21k

[21:02:48] <I_Hate_Mondays> Look at the Blastar chart 
[21:04:31] <ogwebchef888> that was a very awkward pause on the show lol
[21:05:04] <I_Hate_Mondays> Broots and Ian made a killing off PDAI and TEDDY already
[21:05:11] <I_Hate_Mondays> Would be nice for them to show some respect
[21:05:26] <ogwebchef888> Thought the same thing
[21:05:36] <koss11[m]> i havent watched the whole thing.
[21:07:02] <I_Hate_Mondays> Imagine if Broots and Ian promoted BFF instead of Blastar
[21:07:07] <I_Hate_Mondays> Wasted potential 
[21:07:58] <koss11[m]> I dont think they know about it.   and who are you?   Why dont you all register your nick?   Am I not seeing it right?   I registered mine.
