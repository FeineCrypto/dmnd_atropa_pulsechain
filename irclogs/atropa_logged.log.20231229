[02:20:49] <_surfacing86711> cool 
[02:21:06] <_surfacing86711> i wish to contribute more but dont know this language to well. 
[02:21:23] <mariarahel> after that it's encrypted peer tunnelling and distributed peering
[02:21:46] <mariarahel> i plan to set it up with a peer limit of 10
[02:21:58] <_surfacing86711> nice
[02:22:54] <mariarahel> it will record reliability statistics and suggest alternate peers when it hits the limit
[02:23:37] <_surfacing86711> right thats good. will it store good peers or rate peers that are "bad actors"

[02:56:32] <mariarahel> ya, i'll take a look at those soon
[02:56:45] <_surfacing86711> ok. 
[02:57:49] <mariarahel> it just spins the thread for now until you kill it w/ ctrl-c
[02:58:00] <_surfacing86711> right 
[02:58:19] <mariarahel> the Tare class will be used for all the subscriptions message passing
[02:59:14] <_surfacing86711> ok  
[02:59:38] <_surfacing86711> thats the start of the handshake? 
[03:01:06] <_surfacing86711> ok im following the code a bit now 
[03:03:39] <mariarahel> the Faung performs all the internal handshakes
[03:04:15] <mariarahel> once it's over the network either peer only sees half
[03:04:57] <mariarahel> if (!RAD.ContainsKey(HostKey))
[03:04:57] <mariarahel>                 {
[03:04:57] <mariarahel>                     if (!(Math.Abs(bytesRead - Dynamic.Prime.ToByteArray().Length) < 2)) throw new Exception("UnexpectedPeerMessage");
[03:04:57] <mariarahel>                     Meristem Aristotle = new Meristem();
[03:04:57] <mariarahel>                     Aristotle.ClientSocket = Pith.workSocket;
[03:04:58] <mariarahel>                     Aristotle.Tarkhanov = new BigInteger(Pith.buffer);
[03:04:58] <mariarahel>                     BigInteger Ehrenfest = Aristotle.Dirac.Avail(Aristotle.Tarkhanov); 
[03:05:00] <mariarahel>                     Aristotle.Readyness = "Availed";
[03:05:00] <mariarahel>                     RAD.Add(HostKey, Aristotle);
[03:05:02] <mariarahel>                     Send(handler, Ehrenfest);
[03:05:02] <mariarahel>                     Array.Clear(Pith.buffer, 0, Pith.buffer.Length);
[03:05:04] <mariarahel>                     handler.BeginReceive(Pith.buffer, 0, Medulla.BufferSize, 0,
[03:05:04] <mariarahel>                         new AsyncCallback(ReadCallback), Pith);
[03:05:06] <mariarahel>                 }
[03:05:06] <mariarahel> old code looked like that
[03:08:28] <_surfacing86711> ok  
[03:08:51] <mariarahel> no difference in the math whatsoever
[03:09:13] <_surfacing86711> right i can see that 
[03:10:45] <_surfacing86711> cryptography hurts my head a bit 
[03:22:17] <mariarahel> warnings removed from all the in-use classes
[03:22:33] <mariarahel> Fi is being rewritten & Nit is probably going away
[03:22:42] <_surfacing86711> k
[03:25:37] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAP3U-ytje4
[03:26:11] <mariarahel> lol
[03:26:28] <mariarahel> Do It !
[03:27:13] <_surfacing86711> ok im getting warnings but only in fi and nit so looks good now. 
[03:30:04] <mariarahel> I'm thinking of calling the networking class Atlas
[03:30:56] <mariarahel> it will support both client & server and have some initial data functions related to peers and otherwise basic chat server functionality
[03:32:37] <mariarahel> all the msg passing to set up the encryption will occur through a Tare object on each connection state object
[03:33:24] <mariarahel> later this will allow eavesdropping on all locally connected peers
[03:33:40] <mariarahel> until the encryption tunnelling goes in, then it will be useless
[03:33:54] <_surfacing86711> right. ok so like a local port to connect to 
[03:34:13] <mariarahel> no just loaded library and calling the functions
[03:34:28] <_surfacing86711> oh ok 
[03:34:56] <mariarahel> i scrapped the local sockets idea it can just use tcp
[03:35:53] <mariarahel> the linux version particularly i intend to set up so there are multiple ways to run from command line & it might be useful to have more than 1 client running
[03:36:07] <mariarahel> i don't see any use for more than one server per machine though
[03:37:04] <_surfacing86711> right i dont either. 
[03:37:08] <mariarahel> there's a bunch of ways it can go, depending on how i introduce blocks and validation
[03:38:31] <_surfacing86711> totally have you decided on a how validation will occur like pow or pos 
[03:38:42] <mariarahel> for the early versions all the validation signature requirements will be explicit
[03:39:20] <mariarahel> the initial block designs will be required to be signed by the central server
[03:39:55] <_surfacing86711> and that will change later on? 
[03:40:13] <mariarahel> intrinsically, any peer connected to the network should be able to start their only locally-originated locally-signed block-chain
[03:40:20] <mariarahel> their own
[03:40:21] <mariarahel> rather
[03:40:52] <_surfacing86711> i see ok thats what i had thought originally 
[03:40:59] <mariarahel> i'm not sure what the usage preferences will be yet, it's not at all like our existing blockchains
[03:42:11] <mariarahel> once two peers are connected they can generate an unlimited number of post-quantum shared keys
[03:42:30] <mariarahel> so the construction options are rediculous
[03:42:31] <_surfacing86711> right. have you looked at helium before? im not quite sure if its a block chain per say but a decentralized communication network. theres also a similar one that connects wetherstations as well 
[03:42:46] <mariarahel> there have been a lot
[03:43:13] <mariarahel> i did some multicast stuff in uni, been thinking about this stuff since then
[03:44:28] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzS6e6Nyvak
[03:44:30] <_surfacing86711> nice. and now you have the time and audience to build it out. 
[03:44:53] <mariarahel> it's called Exascale computing when you do it on a backplane instead of a network
[03:45:55] <_surfacing86711> crazy 
[03:46:29] <_surfacing86711> but its not a quantum computer
[03:47:14] <mariarahel> depends on how you want to define quantum
[03:47:40] <mariarahel> if two peers can generate post-quantum shared keys then it's quantum
[03:48:04] <_surfacing86711> what about tangled pair encryption? 
[03:48:13] <mariarahel> it is that
[03:48:20] <_surfacing86711> fuck me 
[03:49:14] <mariarahel> that's what will make it compelling
[03:49:44] <mariarahel> it will feel organic and natural to use compared to other encryption systems
[03:50:48] <_surfacing86711> yeah it will. and without the hardware necessary to count qubits or whatever the quantum computers are doing today. 
[03:51:08] <mariarahel> i think those are a fallacy
[03:52:31] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=diarsenide
[03:52:34] <_surfacing86711> interesting. i kinda agree. its an interesting concept but not very efficient nor really anything practical so far. 
[03:53:45] <mariarahel> if you put a magnesium inside a diarsenide that's a qubit
[03:56:09] <_surfacing86711> magnesium is a good wilderness survival tool. does that cause a crazy reaction?

[16:02:36] <mariarahel> I Wish SNL Would Do A Japanese Teddy Bear Buy Back Skit
[16:03:05] <mariarahel> with the conjuring
[16:03:36] <ogwebchef888> Yeah thats why safest to use a wallet just for that if willing
[16:04:05] <ogwebchef888> That would be awesome. Who can make that happen ? 
[16:04:42] <ogwebchef888> we can only conjure teddy 9 right ?
[16:04:53] <ogwebchef888> and its not really profitable to conjure it from what I recall
[16:04:55] <mariarahel> correct, that's the one
[16:05:09] <ogwebchef888> I guess its same thing as buybacks and burn
[16:05:12] <mariarahel> it is currently a sacrifice to conjure one
[16:05:17] <ogwebchef888> Love the design
[16:05:21] <mariarahel> but it might or might not be more expensive to buy a whole one
[16:05:31] <mariarahel> i'm not sure on the numbers
[16:05:33] <ogwebchef888> ahh due to price impact
[16:05:37] <mariarahel> right
[16:05:42] <mariarahel> and very low supply in liquidity
[16:05:53] <mariarahel> and where those liquidities specifically are
[16:06:28] <mariarahel> i think it's the best one so far in terms of technology
[16:06:48] <mariarahel> it's a mutual bond like FPMB
[16:06:48] <ogwebchef888> Fatropac devs have yet to conjure a teddy 9 or writing
[16:07:13] <ogwebchef888> Getting a FPMB issues is fun and helps the eco

[16:07:27] <mariarahel> right, only the FPMB is designed to encourage early experimentation
[16:07:40] <ogwebchef888> I kept getting stuck on the infinite approvals before I managed to issue a few
[16:08:05] <mariarahel> once i integrate the wallet into layer 2 i will make that stuff easy

[17:34:55] <mariarahel> i'm mocking the server loop to collect input from all connections and post each to its own Tare of subscribers as a MSG, then to process its own MsgQueue for outgoing data to each connection
[17:35:12] <mariarahel> the MsgQueue from Apparition might be moved into the Domain on Dysnomia so it can be shared
[17:37:33] <mariarahel> the connections will add tare subscribers initially for Chat-Channel objects of some type
[17:39:38] <mariarahel> instead of having a bunch of logic to process data on the Atlas server/client dll it just processes the incoming & outgoing tcp data from MSG objects with Tare subscriber functions
[17:40:21] <mariarahel> I might be able to build a Kestrel-like server with that instead of using the external code libraries
[17:49:26] <mariarahel> i'm not sure how to build the interface for linux

[17:53:31] <_surfacing8671> interface as in gui? 
[17:54:08] <mariarahel> gui or cli
[17:54:37] <mariarahel> it could run a small web server with very basic input hooks
[17:55:44] <_surfacing8671> i could probably help out with that. 
[17:56:06] <_surfacing8671> i tried to make a cli before but a full gui was easier for me at the time lol 
[17:57:56] <_surfacing8671> most of the time i use vercel to host websites or if running a server for api stuff ill use aws

[20:01:28] <mariarahel> i might consider reimplementing only minimal parts of avalonia to make the Apparition class cross-platform
[20:02:28] <mariarahel> looks like a good option
