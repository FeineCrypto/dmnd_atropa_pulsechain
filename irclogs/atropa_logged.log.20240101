[13:57:00] <mariarahel> I think I have the layer 2 blocks and tokens figured out
[14:01:49] <mariarahel> the initial block states will be intended to not have any sort of shared state and won't be worth anything and there won't be any bridging for a while
[14:02:50] <mariarahel> it will support building out an eventually de-subscribeable layers for chatter & testnets
[14:04:24] <mariarahel> my early plan for testing tokens involves distributed file hosting 
[14:05:48] <mariarahel> for each unique version of this chatlog there will be a tokenized asset id and hodling the file will require anyone who downloads it from you to send you 1 of the tokenized asset tokens for each block of the file they download
[14:06:42] <mariarahel> when you register hodling the file with the network you will automatically receive 1 token per block for the first time
[14:07:05] <mariarahel> if you are the first hoster of the file
[14:08:22] <mariarahel> once someone else downloads the whole file from you, if they choose also to register it they will receive 1 token per block as the file is downloaded from them in distributed search
[14:09:21] fatropac (~oftc-webi@2a0d:5600:13:c47::a02e) joined #atropa_logged.
[14:09:34] <mariarahel> folders will also be able to be tokenized as a collection of the files within them, but those assets will not have token count
[14:10:32] <FREEDOM_777> GM atropa_logged. To a exciting 2024 
[14:11:35] <mariarahel> the early testing will be baselined to a collection of Dysnomia tokens created by the twee.se server
[14:11:43] <mariarahel> fixed number
[14:12:08] <mariarahel> you'll get them for free for participating in the chatter
[14:12:27] <mariarahel> Proof Of Chat
[14:13:26] <mariarahel> by the time of bridged launch there will be no change except pegging the Dysnomia asset initially to some asset on Pulsechain
[14:14:20] <mariarahel> because of the way hosting files is going to work, it is expected that each client will be maintaining their own local swap exchange system
[14:14:47] <mariarahel> so you can host a new file, peg it to one or more asset & people can immediately purchase it for dl
[14:17:34] <mariarahel> also
[14:18:34] <mariarahel> with the next update available for testing i will be adding hot reloading on the server, so there will be a live pipeline from each checkin on github to availability to the client
[14:18:55] <mariarahel> the client will automatically detect disconnect & reconnect
[14:19:51] <mariarahel> the next test i have in mind involves expiration of certificates & will only require the client to re-key every 8 seconds
[14:22:08] <mariarahel> the active certificate key will be the basis for ability to contribute to the first layer chatter
[14:22:36] <mariarahel> i wrote all these parts before so hopefully this week
[14:32:39] <mariarahel> the initial chatter will be fully anonymous with participants identified only by a connection id until handles are implemented
[14:33:24] <mariarahel> handles might be implemented as certified assets
[14:33:47] <mariarahel> handles might be implemented as certified expiring assets
[14:34:19] <mariarahel> those assets will take precedent over the Dysnomia token that will drive the layer 2
[14:36:04] <mariarahel> i expect to eventually implement actual-blockchain as a mock-socket type of tokenized file after the 10-client limits are regularly exhausted and the distributed communication layers come in
[14:36:21] <mariarahel> that part might be hard, i've never gotten it right before
[14:37:11] <mariarahel> so all forms of decentralization for the layer 2 are currently out of scope
[14:37:51] <mariarahel> maybe 2025
[14:39:13] Topic changed on #atropa_logged by mariarahel!~maria@68.170.161.176: Milestone: Expiring Connection Certificates
[14:40:06] <mariarahel> Zero Non-Encrypted Date Will Be Permitted On The Layer 2

[14:57:12] <mariarahel> I'm thinking of using Belphegor's prime for all the contract address stuff
[14:58:20] <mariarahel> 15 digits shorter than eth
[14:58:47] <mariarahel> is a larger prime preferred ?
[14:59:24] <mariarahel> I'm fairly certain it's sufficient
[14:59:53] <mariarahel> the private keys are something wholly different so the only real reason to pick a larger one is collisions
[15:01:44] <mariarahel> the private keys are minimally 4 64-bit random numbers
[15:02:51] <mariarahel> then they grow for everything you connect to
[15:04:07] <mariarahel> 8 64-bit random numbers if you only want to connect to one peer
