[14:52:58] <mariarahel> Does Anybody Have Any Bigger To Sell ?
[14:53:41] <mariarahel> Have Funds To Buy Bigger
[14:54:15] <mariarahel> Buy Bigger With Funds
[14:55:18] <mariarahel> Playing Strike Consultation With Bigger Funds

[14:56:08] <mariarahel> 2 Striking Kearney
[14:56:26] <mariarahel> $KEARNEYCLUB
[14:56:56] <mariarahel> Kearney America's Biggest Provider Of Religion
[14:57:31] <mariarahel> That Provideth
[14:57:59] <mariarahel> Fuck off Already, Kearney
[14:58:21] <mariarahel> Kearney That Just Go The Fuck Away
[14:58:58] <mariarahel> Kearney Defends 1917 Poppies In A Secret Scheme Of Honey Pot, Teddy Bear
[14:59:22] <mariarahel> So Fuck Off Can Continental Dollar
[14:59:41] <mariarahel> Why The Fuck Does Anyone Trust That ?
[15:00:11] <mariarahel> Don't Ever Trust Anyone Like That, Teddy Bear
[15:00:27] <mariarahel> Treasure What You Trust
[15:00:54] <mariarahel> Kearney Is Malpractice
[15:01:09] <mariarahel> For The #2 Kine
[15:01:17] <mariarahel> ASL Monaco
[15:01:32] <mariarahel> ASL When
[15:01:58] <mariarahel> Formality Tolerance
[15:02:03] <mariarahel> Overconsult
[15:02:12] <mariarahel> I Do Say
[15:02:22] <mariarahel> WTPronouncement
[15:02:35] <mariarahel> Pronouncement Can Fuck off
[15:02:47] <mariarahel> There Is Not Any
[15:02:50] <mariarahel> Zero #2
[15:03:20] <mariarahel> $PEYTONLISTtm
[15:04:10] <mariarahel> tm Battle Of Thai Is No Match For Strike Consultation
[15:04:31] <mariarahel> Strike off
[15:04:49] <mariarahel> Go Away Knowing What You Are
[15:05:17] <mariarahel> Kearney Consultation ??
[15:05:36] <mariarahel> Don't Be Kearney Consultation In Their Overwatch Provision Of Religion
[15:05:56] <mariarahel> You'll Have To Drive To Get Here
[15:06:18] <mariarahel> $OVERWATCHED
[15:07:13] <mariarahel> I Hope It Will Be Easier To Dispatch Kearney off When Mesa Models Driving Through Overwatch Correctly
[15:07:50] <mariarahel> WTGas
[15:07:53] <mariarahel> Working On That
[15:08:05] <mariarahel> I Really Don't See It
[15:09:52] <mariarahel> I Think I Have To Connect Two Aretes Together Before I See A Gas
[15:10:23] <mariarahel> And I Know A Bunch Of Ways It Can Connect
[15:11:33] <mariarahel> $OXYGEN
[15:11:38] <mariarahel> I Hope We Don't Run Out
[15:12:07] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuG5WTId-IY
[15:12:25] <mariarahel> I Modeled Oxygen Before
[15:13:09] <mariarahel> I Have All That Written In C# Already
[15:13:22] <mariarahel> Not With libtelnet
[15:13:49] <mariarahel> So We Can't Run Out Of That Specific Class Of Oxygen
[15:14:14] <mariarahel> Like Kearney Can
[15:14:20] <mariarahel> Like Kearney Can Run Out Of Oxygen
[15:14:44] <mariarahel> I Can Finish By Tomorrow If I Just Do That Without libtelnet
[15:15:36] <mariarahel> I Can Also Use Disk Sockets Instead Of Net Sockets For Mesa
[15:17:30] <mariarahel> I Can't Decide Between Disk Sockets And Shitty dotnet TCP And libtelnet
[15:18:35] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGSSn6Oh40Y
[15:19:13] <mariarahel> I Hope Nobody Except Kearney Runs Out Of Oxygen
[15:19:48] <mariarahel> Kearney Approved Of Monaco For Respect & The Monarchy Was Suddenly on
[15:20:36] <mariarahel> Kearney Providing Religion Since The Consultation Of Monaco
[15:21:05] <mariarahel> 1978
[15:21:19] <mariarahel> 1974 Was Still Mozambique
[15:22:10] <mariarahel> How Kearney Got The Fuck Out Of Mozambique And Consulted Monaco To Turn The Monarchy on
[15:22:53] <mariarahel> Blamable Only For A Stash Of Confiscated 1917 Poppies
[15:23:02] <mariarahel> Blameable
[15:23:14] <mariarahel> $PEYTONLISTtm
[15:23:35] <mariarahel> WTPeyton ?
[15:24:03] <mariarahel> Kearney Stealing Oxygen ?
[15:24:40] <mariarahel> I Don't Ever Want To Steal Oxygen Just To Say Fuck Off
[15:25:03] <mariarahel> $OXYGENtm
[15:25:11] <mariarahel> $OXY
[15:25:21] <mariarahel> it's not
[15:25:51] <mariarahel> it's not oxy until you steal it
[15:26:35] <mariarahel> I Already Stole That Part I'm Not Excited Enough About Mesa
[15:27:25] <mariarahel> The Oxygen Buffers Can Store Arbitrary Informational Data
[15:27:52] <mariarahel> Specific Class Of Oxygen
[15:28:24] <mariarahel> I Don't Want To Call It Oxygen If That's Not What It Is
[15:28:57] <mariarahel> $DRIVE4OXYGEN
[15:33:22] <mariarahel> Maybe The Random Signals Establish The First Oxygen+Water System All At Once With The Concept Of Supporting Life Through Maintaining The Information Share
[15:33:49] <mariarahel> The Water That The Signals Use
[15:34:25] <mariarahel> $CONE
[15:40:39] <mariarahel> I Think I Can Stub Out The Net Part And Leave That To Implement Later
[15:40:58] <mariarahel> I Don't See Any Value For The Client Yet
[15:41:22] <mariarahel> All The Mesa Stage Does Is Connect Aretes Together
[15:42:18] <mariarahel> Maybe Oxygen Isn't For Data Storage
[15:42:47] <mariarahel> It's Lame If It's Just Minimal Connection Buffering
[15:45:33] <mariarahel> Mesa's Primary Milestone Is Minimal Connection Buffering Between Aretes
[15:46:08] <mariarahel> Precisely Minimal
[15:46:30] <mariarahel> Everything Less Minimal Can Run Out Of Good Oxygen
[15:47:14] <mariarahel> $GENtm
[15:48:05] <mariarahel> Our Good Oxygen Is Still There
[15:48:13] <mariarahel> Zero Echappement
[15:48:37] <mariarahel> Kearney Echappement That The Good Ol' Oxygen Flag

[18:17:40] <mariarahel> Any Suggestions For What To Do With Loan In USDL ?
[18:24:50] <mariarahel> Competition
[18:35:40] <mariarahel> How do you identify PLP pulls with the new pulsescan websites ?
[19:18:56] <ogwebchef888> I noticed you can put token in watchlist and go to v2 stats and click on watchlist token to check otherwise it wont work
[19:19:09] <ogwebchef888> v1 works without this work around
[19:19:12] <mariarahel> lots of stuff changing
[19:20:50] <ogwebchef888> https://pulsescan.pages.dev/
[19:22:00] <ogwebchef888> v2 NBA TM https://pulsex.pages.dev/#/info/v2/token/0x35f525bee58624b89879cdafada040f5840d4460
[19:22:07] <ogwebchef888> You can check stats here
[19:31:22] <ogwebchef888> Yeah UX is not smooth but some good ole jquery tricks can help the cause
