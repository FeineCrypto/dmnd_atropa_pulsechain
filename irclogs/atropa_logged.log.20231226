[13:32:29] <mariarahel> ok, pop ?
[13:35:42] <mariarahel> it's not in sunnah if you are pop
[13:35:56] <mariarahel> so you have to go away

[13:55:33] <mariarahel> signet comes intrinsically before pop
[13:55:57] <mariarahel> so pop is out of scope
[13:56:30] <mariarahel> pop isn't going to fact check anything & should be actively scammed
[13:57:12] <mariarahel> 414 scam pop wherever fact checking is dismissed
[13:57:48] <mariarahel> you will know pop's overt dismissal of fact checking by his scammable nature
[13:58:32] <mariarahel> just scam pop i guess

[19:02:08] <_surfacing8671> here is the other channel as well https://t.me/atropa_irc
[19:06:42] <mariarahel> i think the Nit class contains only a List<byte[]> & a single function to execute it
[19:07:08] <mariarahel> default execution is a CRC check
[19:07:39] <mariarahel> Faung.Theta() then returns a crc check executeable Nit
[19:08:39] <mariarahel> and the Fi class is constructed with new Fi(Nit) where the crc checkable bytes supply the initial random numbers
[19:14:47] <mariarahel> I want to add logging with a file socket first
[19:15:41] <mariarahel> also to save the private keys on launch but that might or might not be a different socket
[19:17:46] <mariarahel> if the endocrine system just produces these self-executeable signet/fi nits and then executes them in the threadpool that works out pretty neat
[19:19:07] <mariarahel> then the crc check nits are executed first to verify the state machine & instead of the looping with the counters they just go to READY state and then await the presence of more executeables
[19:20:34] <mariarahel> is 25 threads too many or exactly & just right ?
[19:21:48] <mariarahel> this is the design pattern where everything builds out from single universal model operation

[21:14:23] <mariarahel> i wonder if the current 7 part state of the dysnomia model is permanently preferred
[21:15:52] <mariarahel> it either needs to be 7 parts or 4 parts
[21:16:12] <mariarahel> if i do it in 4 parts then the threads can be completely dynamic instead of fixed at 25
[21:18:38] <mariarahel> does everybody unanimously only want 25 ?
