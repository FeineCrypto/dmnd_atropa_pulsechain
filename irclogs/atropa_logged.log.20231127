[03:55:19] <mariarahel> Does Everyone Completely Understand The Concept Of Daf Within The Mishnah In Terms Of The Real Life Situations That Are A Result Of The Yibbum Law ?
[03:55:34] <mariarahel> Buy Rabbinical Studies
[03:56:42] <mariarahel> Daf, In Terms Of The Rabinical Studies Is A Fringe Concept To Me Personally Being In No Way In Any Portion Concerned With The Individual Specifics Of The Shapes Written Large In The Letters
[03:57:19] <mariarahel> The Specific Shapes Being Written Large In The Letters Being Sincerely The Only Concept Of Interest Within Core Rabbinical Studies

[04:00:31] <mariarahel> Daf Is Specific For Not Being Related To The Letters Because It Is In Fact Concerned With One Or More Specifically Female And Usually Welsh Individuals Whose More Or Less Just Handwriting Yiddish-Not-Vathek-Zombie-Rote-Student-Hat-EHLO From Before They Went In The Ground Serves As The Exceptionless Foundations For Writing By Men Who Intend To Convey Absolutely No Sense Whatsoever Of Those Welsh Females Were Before The Sandanista Ecole Educated Ever
