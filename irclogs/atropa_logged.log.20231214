[01:57:05] <_surfacing8671> so this is what your normal eth_call rpc will look like   
[01:57:10] <_surfacing8671> {"method":"eth_call","params":[{"to":"0xebe8efa441b9302a0d7eaecc277c09d20d684540","data":"CALLDATA"},"latest"],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}
[01:58:20] <_surfacing8671> the to being said contract you want to call and the CALLDATA is the encoded data that is used to make the function call. note tho at this point the last call that calldata is signed data by a wallet or PK. 
[01:58:47] <_surfacing8671> unless of course you are just calling a view function. then it doesnt need to be signed
[02:09:36] <_surfacing8671> to get the calldata witch im assuming is the part that is more complicated, i use ethers.js to construct the encrypted transaction callData. with ethers i can load up the abi of the contract and do a router.populateTransaction.swapExactETHForTokens(ARGS) and that will give me the raw transaction data. this still needs to be signed tho for it to work. i just send the tx with signer.sendTransaction and because im using the sign
[02:09:37] <_surfacing8671> re it will sign the data for it to work. but you can always use the ethers.signTransaction to then sign the data and you should have you end callData that you can use in eth_call
