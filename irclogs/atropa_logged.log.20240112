[15:24:11] <mariarahel> i hope we get some demoscene style animation materials soon
[15:24:25] <_surfacing8671> have we thought about using the handshake as a way to communicate to a wallet. not an eoa wallet but a smart contract one. bio organisms and all you could send the contract that holds your funds some complex plays. so currently there is a complex way to do this via a bundler and entrypoint contract and that wouldnt be as simple as a straight connection to the wallet.  
[15:24:35] <_surfacing8671> i have a good artist 
[15:25:57] <mariarahel> and maybe a TOol song

[23:51:36] <mariarahel> i don't think a pairing with dOWN is appropriate
[23:52:43] <mariarahel> because of the savings aspect, BFF should rather be paired with assets that are designed to grow fast or are specifically designed around friendly natured concepts
[23:53:10] <mariarahel> if dOWN goes especially well, it might not be friendly at all :)
[23:53:31] <mariarahel> and yes i have had 1 coffee cheat so far on the purium cleanse but that's all
[23:53:33] <StuartLittle> Give me Liberty or give me death
[23:53:39] <mariarahel> i'm counting it as one of my flex foods
[23:54:09] <mariarahel> did anybody exploit the 2 for 1 bug ? 
[23:54:10] <StuartLittle> Have to start somewhere. Congrats. Keep up the hard work.
[23:54:58] <mariarahel> shilled tokens a little bit around rodeo drive, it's still too hard for me to sell entry wise though
[23:55:28] <mariarahel> i think i can release a FENDI token if i want to
