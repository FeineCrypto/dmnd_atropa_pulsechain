[00:09:50] <_surfacing8671> i broke it. ran alpha after connecting 
[00:10:02] <mariarahel> it's not passing messages yet
[00:10:06] <mariarahel> did it throw an error ?
[00:10:36] <_surfacing8671> yeah unhandled index outside of the bounds of the array 
[00:11:01] <mariarahel> hmm
[00:11:07] <_surfacing8671> at Dysnomia.Domain.Oracle.Phi()  
[00:11:15] <_surfacing8671> line 222 maybe 
[00:11:24] <mariarahel> doesn't crash on windows :)
[00:11:45] <_surfacing8671> must be a linux thing then. 
[00:12:56] <mariarahel> works as long as you supply an argument
[00:13:02] <_surfacing8671> oh 
[00:13:26] <mariarahel> if you have space but no argument after alpha it will crash
[00:14:46] <_surfacing8671> i see 
[00:17:57] <mariarahel> ohh
[00:18:09] <mariarahel> it's a race condition with the vm, sec
[00:20:25] <_surfacing8671> nice 
[00:21:18] <mariarahel> can't get it to crash on windows
[00:22:03] <mariarahel> the line 222 crash should be fixed at least

[03:00:56] <mariarahel> getting a lot more random connects with no handshake than i would expect

[22:14:39] <Yogi> Why would we make a pinata token, for profit?

[22:15:13] <mariarahel> to have a token to talk about in relation to any uncertainty relating to the mypinata website being the primary entrance to the swap interface
[22:15:42] <mariarahel> it can be 666 or 777 or some other supply
[22:15:50] <mariarahel> 111

[22:16:06] <mariarahel> i think low supply makes it more playable 
[22:17:05] <mariarahel> if i tie the complete supply to teddy bear & they can be talked about together
[22:17:21] <Yogi> I want this coin to only go up and not down, I’ll invest and we can talk about the piñata token all day. I still don’t see why we need to talk about the piñata swap interface even if it goes down what will the piñata token do? 
[22:17:35] <mariarahel> i bet advertising can get a teddy bear & a pinata in front of people who have no idea about us
[22:18:02] <mariarahel> newbie confidence is really really bad currently
[22:18:05] Yogi (~oftc-webi@2a09:bac3:7d49:4be::79:21) left irc: Remote host closed the connection
[22:20:46] <mariarahel> i would probably put 110 up for liquidity with some amount of teddy bear & burn the liquidity
[22:20:51] <mariarahel> it would only go up from there
[22:21:26] <mariarahel> i could do $100 or $1000 or $10000 of initial liquidity
[22:21:55] <mariarahel> i'm sure i would get return on 1 + any early buyback to make it worth it
[22:22:38] <mariarahel> i'm not yet happy enough with the mypinata situation to jump for joy at $10k

[22:53:22] <ead11> People never turn down a pinata at a party 
[22:53:58] <mariarahel> if they want to release their own that might be an even stronger option
[22:55:03] <mariarahel> if it's gonna last as primary entry point then it should be memed so it has a better visibility
[22:55:37] <ead11> I currently run the teddy group in telegram I could hang up the pinata there
[23:02:59] <mariarahel> i dunno if they're clear to trust yet still
[23:05:19] <mariarahel> what are the first few awesome things to do after setting up geth for the first time ?
