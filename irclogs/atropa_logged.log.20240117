By the way I ran this whole chat log through my ai user chat bot platform to better understand and learn and it told me this about you "mariarahel appears to be a knowledgeable and experienced individual in the field of cryptocurrency, specifically in the creation and management of tokens on the PulseChain platform. They demonstrate a deep understanding

Mariarahel is likely skilled in strategizing for token launches, managing liquidity, and engaging with a community of investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

[16:57:35] <Vlad_> you can do cool stuff though to enhance security by applying some decentralized practices such as running all the data you save in backend via a hashfunction similar how proton.me does it and everyone user can have their own key and giver permissions to what data the developer can decode I think this is the future of design not just having a password hashed in a db but every field

I want to see an $8k (and beyond) BFF because I want to see the PulseChain community use it as a Light to not only be blessed but to bless others. I believe in that and believe we can see great acts of altriusm and community building. BFF! Have a great day.
