[16:13:28] <ogwebchef888> Any use case for OTPF for the initial Terminal-Entry Style UI ? It was really engaging to participate with those style of puzzles. Perhaps if that gets reintroduced in a way where some of us contribute to the Chatlog token release
[16:14:02] <ogwebchef888> would bring in some builders to help bring us closer
[16:14:18] <mariarahel> there will absolutely be at least one of those
[16:14:30] <ogwebchef888> Nice, i'm into it.
[16:14:44] <mariarahel> it should be impossible until the states are shared
[16:15:05] <mariarahel> even a shitty one
[16:15:13] <ogwebchef888> Ok
[16:17:03] <mariarahel> It's shaped like a heart with 2 nodes for the front end to connect with 2 nodes on the back end and a pulse with 25 threads expected to perform duties based on the 2+2 connections
[16:17:29] <mariarahel> 3 of those 25 threads have shared state between the front & back end
[16:18:43] <mariarahel> all the UI updates will occur from the back end and all the active-connection state stuff will occur from the front end
[16:18:59] <mariarahel> it's inside-out

[16:22:23] <mariarahel> there is no ui yet really
[16:23:04] <mariarahel> there's an opcode based message queue and I presume all the UI related stuff will run from the 2 threads on Zuo

[16:24:50] <ogwebchef888> Will there be a new repo on busytoby github account?
[16:25:00] <ogwebchef888> Where can we contribute
[16:25:19] <mariarahel> there will be a linux project added soon after the first network stack integration
[16:25:43] <mariarahel> i don't plan to make the source contributable at this time
[16:25:56] <ogwebchef888> üêß
[16:26:43] <mariarahel> i have a plugin stack i can integrate at any time that would support the creation of a user contributeable plugin foundry
[16:26:44] <ogwebchef888> Sounds impressive to say the least. Can't wait to see how it unfolds
[16:27:05] <mariarahel> i haven't tested that on linux either though
[16:27:24] <mariarahel> i think it's supposed to just work
[16:27:28] <mariarahel> for same dotnet version
[16:28:59] <ogwebchef888> Makes sense. I'm more into python than asp/.net but find it intriguing should be cross compatible
