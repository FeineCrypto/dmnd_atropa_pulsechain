[00:20:06] <Yogi> That makes sense, I’m not trying to use the Atropa eco for a quick gain, I’m trying to gain confidence because I want to inject a lot of capital and don’t want to make the wrong decision

[00:53:08] <mariarahel> the Living class will be intended only to be instantiated at a class member level from the Daemon class
[00:53:52] <mariarahel> so all the commands in bin will have stdio like options
[00:54:44] <Tetragrammaton33> whats going on with twee.se? seems like its down
[00:54:46] <mariarahel> the Serialization Daemon will handle all the blockchain stuff after block 0
[00:55:15] <mariarahel> it's up on port 5555
[00:55:47] <mariarahel> i am contemplating a situation where one host could maintain many "blockchains"

[00:56:52] <mariarahel> i haven't figured out all the proofs yet
[00:59:27] <mariarahel> transfer of certificates..
[01:03:13] <_surfacing8671> and this will all open a connection to the chain not build blocks. would the certificate transfer be something like on chain or like a browser cookie that stores metadata.

[01:52:01] <mariarahel> i think i figured out block datum 1
[01:52:23] <mariarahel> there will never be anything like http
[01:54:09] <mariarahel> opcode 0x08 will be identical to opcode 0x01 except it expects an argument for the client to apply the alpha transform to
[01:54:56] <mariarahel> 0x09 will be the same for the beta transform like verified at opcode 0x02
[01:57:49] <mariarahel> i'm thinking 0x10 will have 2 arguments for client & data bytes[] and it will just send the raw data through the encrypted buffer to be decoded by the peer
[01:58:39] <mariarahel> still no permanent block state in sight though
[02:03:10] <mariarahel> opcode 0x08 can be thought of as identical to the Avail() functions
[02:03:32] <mariarahel> and 0x09 to Form()
[02:03:44] <mariarahel> except that the argument is a connected peer instead of an integer
[02:04:39] <mariarahel> ending in Bond()
[02:05:23] <mariarahel> Bond() observable at the accepted speed of light
[02:05:50] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YmKho9jJbE
[02:07:30] <mariarahel> opcode 0x11 will send MSG packets as defined in the Tare class
[02:08:00] <mariarahel> then I can add a 'say' command for chat

[14:39:48] <mariarahel> holding in those 3 pools almost 60% of supply
[14:41:57] <mariarahel> as the Atropa Ecosystem is bought into, dOWN is intended to reflect the involvement of broad investment in the core critical assets :)

[15:01:18] <mariarahel> 5 other wallets above 1% is really pretty good for how i see exposure of the dev
