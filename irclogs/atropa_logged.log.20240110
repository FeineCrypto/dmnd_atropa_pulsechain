[20:06:11] <mariarahel> if everybody could associate the information with the words it would have value
[20:07:19] <mariarahel> i think it it best to sell out the entire 666 to nonukes in this one run
[20:07:36] <mariarahel> and then we can discuss what is best done with the nonukes tokens bought back
[20:08:09] <mariarahel> almost 30 tokens bought back

[21:32:52] <_surfacing8671> it is low. and agreed. focus needs to be realigned

[21:36:42] <mariarahel> ecuador revolution against the penrose society without "Pause"
[21:43:29] <_surfacing8671> i was reading the chatlog and noticed that you were talking about the many blockchains and blocks the eat themselves. so with that system would the chain only exist within the handshake and message between peers? 
[21:44:06] <mariarahel> more or less, i think that's accurate
[21:45:25] <_surfacing8671> cool. thats an interesting idea. 
[21:45:29] <mariarahel> so your local blockchain copy need not ever contain more than your own relevant data and the additional keys needed to traverse the network to produce any blockchain actions
[21:46:07] <mariarahel> but also that a primary function would be generating local data on your own chain for peers to pick up on
[21:46:22] <mariarahel> via subscriptions
[21:46:55] <mariarahel> so locking handshakes based on checksum data
[21:47:03] <koss11[m]> Robin__: Robin Tu lengua de Google es perfecto, Mi esposa es de Venezuela.   Yo entiendo todos.  Yo de Los Estados Unidos.  Yo soy Americano.
[21:47:04] <mariarahel> for the key-chain
[21:47:25] <mariarahel> and then the data-chain is just like a hash table that the key-chain references and holds any kind of data private or shared
[21:47:54] <_surfacing8671> the data chain would be like the server or main ledger? 
[21:48:05] <mariarahel> but if everybody deletes the data for something then the shared network only remembers the keys that were used and none of the data specifics
[21:48:52] <_surfacing8671> right it records the action that happened but the info is irrelevant and erased for space 
[21:48:54] <mariarahel> there would be a primary-data-chain-like origin containing all locally retained data for each server-capable host
[21:49:27] <_surfacing8671> and would the local host then update the primary like daily or something 
[21:49:49] <mariarahel> it's going to be basically a client/server subscription model
[21:49:58] <_surfacing8671> kinda like arbitrum batching tx together on ethereum. layer 2 stuff? 
[21:50:00] <_surfacing8671> ok 
[21:50:21] <mariarahel> so initially you'll subscribe to "Chatlog" on whatever server you connect to and receive all new blocks that the server sends
[21:50:35] <mariarahel> with the server optionally being able to send you older messages
[21:51:37] <mariarahel> i don't have it solid yet
[21:51:41] <_surfacing8671> could this possible work offline or like between peers locally 
[21:52:02] <mariarahel> it already works offline as long as you complete the handshake
[21:52:20] <mariarahel> you can encrypt, pass data through some other means & decrypt without the network stack
[21:52:55] <mariarahel> the blocks are a different question that individual encryptions though
[21:53:16] <mariarahel> ostensibly the target for what they should contain is more 'lifeforms' than 'tokens' or 'blocks'
[21:53:27] <_surfacing8671> right. and then be at some later pair to the network or like witchever one does pair to the network. updates both balances lets say . 
[21:53:55] <_surfacing8671> cool
[21:54:05] <mariarahel> it could work out a lot of different ways, i don't have it all worked out yet
[21:55:26] <mariarahel> i can do lots of data stuff and it's ready to move the chatlog forward as is, but I have possibly missing potential where I have no idea what transform to apply next to make them lifeforms
[21:56:05] <_surfacing8671> no forsure theres a lot of possibilities this opens up.

[22:00:59] <mariarahel> i do not know the additional requirements e coli have beyond tactile self-reflection
[22:06:51] <_surfacing8671> with the route of transmission being different then most more cases will emerge over time. 
[22:13:13] <mariarahel> the self-consuming data packet needs to have realities of muscle memory & behavioral regularities & a context of movement
[22:13:55] <mariarahel> and may or may not be compatible with the same system that can more readily accomplish retaining a chatlog

[22:47:23] <Robin__> @mariarahel Do you think it is better to move from token code to nonuke?
[22:49:30] <dreadedh_> @mariarahel - do launches around this time do better than 8 hours ago?
[22:50:37] <koss11[m]> What telegram group are you guys in to ask these questions?  
[22:50:44] <mariarahel> i wouldn't be able to sell it out in 1 day if launched this late
[22:51:56] <mariarahel> up to 194 holders
[22:52:07] <mariarahel> possibly if it had 4x or more the traffic
[22:52:11] <dreadedh_> for better launches I think a telegram announcement channel would be better. simple anounements - new token - can't be minted or nuked - deets...
[22:53:05] <dreadedh_> noting else to distract
[22:53:09] <mariarahel> i don't use any software like that
[22:54:38] <koss11[m]> there is a tg group for when Maria (414) launches a token

[22:57:35] <Robin__> I don't know about that TG group, could you please pass the link. Thank you.
[22:58:56] <dreadedh_> a new token announcement needs a little more - safe to buy or not etc...
[22:59:51] <koss11[m]> thanks for link Freedom
[23:00:02] <koss11[m]> was gonna post you beat me to it :)
[23:00:16] <dreadedh_> @mariarahal you didn't post the contract address, so I think some would have missed it. I think a simple launch anouncement, all in 1 message so it can be easily shared.
