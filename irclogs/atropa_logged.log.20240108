[15:34:42] <mariarahel> i'm going to add configuration systems to the serialization to start testing data storage and retrieval

[15:36:07] <mariarahel> depending on how the local blockchain-encryption-storage blocks go the network protocol might change

[15:37:20] <mariarahel> the blockchain serializations all start with a standard byte followed by 5 4xDLE delimited private key numbers
[15:37:40] <mariarahel> followed by two level-0 public key numbers
[15:38:49] <mariarahel> the numbers are more or less modulo motzkin's prime
[15:39:44] <mariarahel> complex levels of public keys will make it easy to achieve more privacy from any level of the chatlog
[15:41:04] <mariarahel> i'm thinking of using 0x13 as the opcode for lists
[15:41:47] <mariarahel> maybe 0x14
[15:42:43] <mariarahel> probably 0x13
[15:44:19] <mariarahel> i'll probably make the configuration data serialization slow and generic with lots of error checking and then make it faster later after search gets slow

[20:04:30] <FREEDOM_777> New ATH on BFF today 🥁
[20:08:13] <mariarahel> 255 holders now
[20:08:59] <mariarahel> top 4 spots likely out of reach for new entry
[20:09:47] <mariarahel> don't expect to be able to sell a lot when the price first hits target, but i think the # can be maintained after it gets there
[20:11:17] <FREEDOM_777> Yes and you mentioned Liquidity providing at the first target too I think others in the community will as well.
[20:14:17] <mariarahel> the top two liquidity pools have 66 tokens still available, i would have thought less by now
[20:16:06] <mariarahel> i will place and burn the liquidity with teddy bear as soon as it hits the mark & we can see what happens
[20:17:32] <mariarahel> my goal will be to reduce my number of tokens to 93 while keeping the price above $8k and burning liquidities
[20:17:45] <FREEDOM_777> there are others that want to provide Liquidity as well, would Teddy be the best route to go, you mentioned NoNukes and INC as wellm
[20:18:04] <FREEDOM_777> as well*
[20:18:32] <mariarahel> i think having 1 or 2 BFF paired with a large number of separate tokens is the best way to support long term price inflation
[20:19:22] <FREEDOM_777> yea everyone needs a bff

[21:42:31] <Slothman_> @mariarahel Unleash the rebellious spirit, pondering the potential of PUNK: a fleeting dance or an enduring anthem?
[21:42:48] <mariarahel> a death sentence
[21:43:55] <Slothman_> Whispers in the shadows echo: Can the dormant find revival, or is fate etched in stone?

[21:51:30] <mariarahel> the first certificates are configuration variables

[22:06:46] <gebFSra_> Hello, Maria ! what should we do with monat?
[22:08:36] <gebFSra_> are you going to do something with monatmoney?? our community simply does not understand what will happen to it next
[22:09:09] <mariarahel> someone will always have an idea

[22:15:11] <mariarahel> really fatty arbuckle
[22:15:51] <gebFSra_> what about monat money?? will he be next after the teddy bear?
[22:16:18] <mariarahel> which character ?
[22:16:48] <mariarahel> guy that will spend it
[22:17:48] <mariarahel> currency standardization destroyed the monat
[22:19:30] <mariarahel> if the dysnomia layer of the atropa ecosystem layer 2 is going to be a framework, it will benefit me to get a better perspective of supporting it for pure generic use patterns first
[22:20:09] <mariarahel> disk i/o and data storage & retrieval is a big part of that useability
[22:20:54] <mariarahel> i already mocked up a shell.cs that would let the terminal navigate through folders and run binaries from specific folders
[22:21:23] <mariarahel> should the local blockchain store every folder navigation that ever occurs ?
[22:25:28] <mariarahel> if it only goes in the log it's not queryable

[23:25:43] <mariarahel> 2chains shot somebody
[23:52:59] <mariarahel> irony in bff planning
[23:54:32] <mariarahel> if price reaches $8k, and on day 1 I sell 1 BFF for teddy bear and burn liquidity it raises the price of teddy bear an amount greater than any sell of BFF can drop it, whereas if i do not sell but place BFF liquidity on tokens I already hold then the net product of any sell afterwards results in a loss in teddy bear price
[23:56:17] <mariarahel> worth considering for those who bought in very early
[23:57:49] <mariarahel> looking at 1.2m in total liquidity pairings to be placed from my bag alone
[23:58:32] <mariarahel> I am presuming we can attract a specific level of buyers by maintaining the price at $8k while we do this
