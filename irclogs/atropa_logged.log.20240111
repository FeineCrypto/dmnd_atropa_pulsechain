[00:18:31] <mariarahel> if there is overwhelming support the nonukes buyback can be used to pump bff

[00:19:49] <thurston> i think the majority would support that
[00:19:56] <mariarahel> other options are to pump monat, or liberty
[00:20:49] <mariarahel> there are 180 Penrose tokens left to sell with 201 holders currently
[00:21:04] <mariarahel> leaders are tied at 27 tokens
[00:23:28] <thurston> at least 2 top penrose holders would vote the bff option. everyone is behind bff push to 8k
[00:25:00] <thurston> and would likely burn some in LP too at that target
[00:25:20] <_surfacing8671> gotta show proof

[00:53:05] <ZACH> If you have any suggestions for how the website should be presented please let me know, otherwise we will do what we think is appropriate

[01:29:42] <mariarahel> d11 leading
[01:34:21] <mariarahel> i'm predicting a target price of around $100 after a few days exposure on Penrose
[01:35:24] <mariarahel> visceral influence will sell it
[01:35:59] <mariarahel> someone will want to own 100 tokens
[01:37:55] <mariarahel> success of the annabelle token will possibly bring it into play later
[01:40:58] <mariarahel> if the mud aspect of the layer 2 grows positively there will definitely be creatorship opportunities early on for token holders

[01:43:29] <BFF_Genos> Hey maria, will the no name token with 100 supply play a big role within the L2? Currently 152 holders. 
[01:43:58] <mariarahel> there aren't any no name tokens

[01:46:14] <BFF_Genos> okay haha because there is a TG with 70 members we all thought it didn’t have a name, thanks for the clarification. For some reason that name doesn’t pop up on pulsescan or dexscreener

[01:58:59] <mariarahel> running a bit ahead of schedule
[02:04:55] <mariarahel> i think the numbers look pretty good
[02:05:16] <mariarahel> we will see how much the bff price is influenced
[02:06:01] <mariarahel> i would recommend buying that one especially if you still have no idea what penrose is
[02:06:39] <mariarahel> buy bff while we pump to $8k and then be a critic to how we place the liquidities

[03:24:52] <mariarahel> Penrose Up Over $100
[03:26:08] <mariarahel> remember our goal is to reduce the liquidity to a squeeze as we go up to $8k and then to hold that support level while placing small liquidities as the level is established
[03:27:33] <mariarahel> almost to top already
[03:29:49] <mariarahel> https://scan.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeidn64pd2u525lmoipjl4nh3ooa2imd7huionjsdepdsphl5slfowy/#/token/0xFFC84Bb47756845C68bEFe1898CC39A16FbDcAEF?tab=holders
[03:30:02] <mariarahel> burnt liquidity has almost 100
[03:30:53] <mariarahel> at least 107 of the 200 i currently hold will be placed in burned liquidity after we hit the mark

[03:40:01] <mariarahel> thoughts in post ?
[03:40:19] <mariarahel> anything that went wrong ?
[03:41:10] <_surfacing8671> i liked it 
[03:41:28] <_surfacing8671> super degen and thats a plus 
[03:41:44] <_surfacing8671> and more fun 
[03:51:50] <mariarahel> good stunt good scheme
[03:52:49] <mariarahel> consider these events & buy bff ?
[03:53:20] <_surfacing8671> yes 
[03:53:24] <mariarahel> just with prostitute money
[03:53:36] <_surfacing8671> the dirtiest 
[03:55:09] <mariarahel> i think we will see a few more waves of support come in, i think the numbers all look pretty good for now
[03:56:05] <mariarahel> the liquidity stands i think at about 55 bff tokens
[03:56:56] <mariarahel> we will start to see the liquidity pressure around 25 tokens remaining
[03:57:40] <_surfacing8671> will keep an eye out 
[03:59:11] <mariarahel> peak price was $2475
[03:59:32] <mariarahel> https://dexscreener.com/pulsechain/0xffc84bb47756845c68befe1898cc39a16fbdcaef
[04:00:45] <mariarahel> could have been better to buy in at a slower rate
[04:00:56] <mariarahel> a lot of profit was taken from the top
[04:01:14] <mariarahel> tbh i think that's fine
[04:01:18] <mariarahel> for this token
[04:01:41] <_surfacing8671> i think it is health for that to happen. 
[04:01:41] <dreadedh_> hopefully it goes back to printing some nice bullish pennants.
[04:02:48] <_surfacing8671> it allows for more holders to enter helping lower volatility 
[04:03:15] <_surfacing8671> maybe better buying large now and getting it out of system then taper the buys. idk. 
[04:03:51] <dreadedh_> penrose back down.
[04:04:02] <mariarahel> at $1833 now I think it's a solid entry point for buy in > $5k
[04:04:21] <_surfacing8671> maybe the effect of the hard pump causes the sell off but more people would be holding longer if it was gradual for a larger chance of an even worse collapse maybe. 
[04:04:23] <mariarahel> below that i think it could dip further
[04:04:50] <mariarahel> it will be interesting to see the chart tomorrow

[14:05:09] <mariarahel> bff overnight low around $1650 now trailing $2000
[14:05:40] <mariarahel> if we can hit $2500 i will consider additional means of pumping
[14:06:17] <mariarahel> otherwise i think i have figured out the next short-term milestone on the codebase
[14:06:28] <mariarahel> "Surveys"
[14:07:35] <mariarahel> first after handshake the server & client may perform connection surveys to query details about either host
[14:09:44] <mariarahel> optionally all data related to the connection surveys can be required to be contained in a primitive local db-like state
[14:17:21] <mariarahel> I might extend the Tare class to support the storage and retrieval of configuration data to support the surveys
[14:19:12] <mariarahel> i'm not sure if MSG goes in there or somewhere else
[14:30:09] <mariarahel> if we get to $2500 we can look through all the data together and determine what good options are availale
[14:32:22] <mariarahel> it almost always works well for me to find symmetry between multiple tasks and use them to solve each other
[14:36:51] <mariarahel> Penrose holding mid-range at $70
[14:37:23] <mariarahel> average sale token price was about $45-50

[14:51:10] <mariarahel> probably 1 in 2 or better in the immediate audience
[14:55:11] <mariarahel> if Tare inherits from Serialization and Gram() becomes argumentless the subscriber delegates can support generic MSG formats
[14:57:47] <mariarahel> if Gram() can return a Tare then the publisher function calls can check result and clear the serialization queue on successful data parsing
[14:58:37] <mariarahel> then there is no MSG class at all

[18:02:43] <mariarahel> nice !
[18:03:02] <mariarahel> suggestion box is open until 2pm
[18:03:14] <mariarahel> then we will decide what move to make
[18:05:39] <mariarahel> i'm not sure either way if another token launch similar to penrose but over a longer (2 full days) time frame and more announced might be a viable option
[18:06:02] <mariarahel> i have 22 NoNukes tokens on hand that could pump the price up to about $500 
[18:07:17] <mariarahel> i might consider actions involving the treasury wallet
[18:08:17] <mariarahel> i can also consider pairing with one of the internal tokens to pump, like scissors
