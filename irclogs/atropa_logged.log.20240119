[01:51:26] <burgundy> maria im trying to support bff as much as i can but im low on funds, do you think i should sell some 666 coins for the cause? 
[01:56:39] <mariarahel> i would suggest BFF as the better investment short or long term vs those
[01:59:21] <mariarahel> i am sure we will see spikes over time with the 666 tokens but i do not consider them a good investment
[01:59:58] <mariarahel> i can see value in having them display from time to time in the top transactions and value changes though
[02:03:13] <mariarahel> when the layer 2 is in place & gamified holding them in your wallet will have game consequences
[02:03:40] <burgundy> sayless 
[02:04:39] <mariarahel> sending certain tokens to your enemy will give you advantage over them while they hold the tokens
[02:05:31] <burgundy> oh no i cant let that happen
[02:06:15] <burgundy> can you speak more about this "game"
[02:07:00] <mariarahel> the target for now is only the room based communication system
[02:07:42] <mariarahel> there will not be any wallet integration for some time
[02:08:04] <mariarahel> and the game/s only after that
[02:08:38] <mariarahel> the Discworld Mud is primary inspiration
[02:10:02] <burgundy> ill pretend i understand what that means bc i love u

[02:19:46] <Thursday_> So in this game the tokens will essentially not matter then? What matters more is their liquidity/position within the ecosystem? 
[02:20:01] <Thursday_> And will it be a metaverse game? 
[02:21:55] <Thursday_> Token name*
[02:23:00] <mariarahel> i expect the early versions to be a lot like discworld mud
[02:24:54] <Thursday_> And is the ultimate goal to educate people on computer science?
[02:25:31] <Thursday_> While potentially rewarding them with tokens that will appreciate in value relative to pulsechains success and the games?
[02:26:25] <mariarahel> moreso to build a non-http oriented system for interracting with blockchain
[02:27:07] <mariarahel> the gaming features are basic proving ground for extending the technology on and on
[02:27:33] <Thursday_> Would the game cost money initially or are you looking for ways to make it free to play? 
[02:27:46] <Thursday_> I know you spoke about the ojeon a long time ago
[02:28:07] <mariarahel> there must be a primary public interface that is always free
[02:29:00] <Thursday_> Do you plan to sell rights to the ecosystem once it's complete or are you always going to have ownership?
[02:30:00] <mariarahel> centralized portions should have value and be transferable
[02:30:31] <mariarahel> all that is still out of scope

[02:44:53] <Thursday_> If we get to 8k on bff and there's lp with teddy, do you think that will be good or bad for the teddy price?
[02:47:58] <irceo> Good
[02:49:53] <Thursday_> I don't ask as a means to receive a tip, I ask because if it could bring up the price of teddy in the process, couldn't we do the same with bff? A bff whale launches a different token with the promise of burning their lp with their bff holdings at a certain price? 
[02:50:05] <irceo> More lps creates more networks in the "humain system" . See it as the blood flow in your body. You want many circuits (many lps)

[02:51:33] <Thursday_> Right I'm just not sure what pairing lp's to bff will do to the price of bff before the 8k goal is achieved 
[02:52:26] <irceo> No price only ratio
[02:54:37] <irceo> @mariarahel: you think the 666 tokens are not good investment. You mean short term ?
[02:55:16] <Thursday_> There are so many good options out there, I'm not sure why you would choose a 666
[02:55:25] <irceo> Cause like you said, when layer 2 will launch, these 666 tokens will be very valuable 
[02:57:56] <Thursday_> I don't think that's exactly what was said
[03:02:00] <irceo> Using them to attack your opponents that mean its a valuable token
[03:04:01] <mariarahel> is cucumbers a pixar token ?

[03:06:31] <Thursday_> maria have you considered a scratch card for tokens of some sort?
[03:06:48] <mariarahel> what's that ?
[03:06:59] <Thursday_> Like when you play bingo on a scratch card to win money 
[03:07:10] <Thursday_> but instead of money you win tokens 
[03:07:22] <Thursday_> Not sure how that would be done but it may attract a lot of investors
[03:07:37] <mariarahel> i don't like the idea of anything being at chance really
[03:07:52] <mariarahel> outcomes should be predictable and regular
[03:08:45] <mariarahel> for the pulse side anyway
[03:08:51] <Thursday_> Right but if the person "wins" ojeon tokens they'll want to "claim" their prize 
[03:09:11] <Thursday_> Which can only happen by being onboarded into the ecosystem 
[03:09:25] <mariarahel> i'm not opposed to a third party introducing those sort of actions 
[03:09:46] <mariarahel> right now i think we should only be onboarding people to make money
[03:10:07] <mariarahel> when we hit all the numbers then the other aspects can start opening up
[03:11:53] <mariarahel> first win the real world game, then make the fake one
[03:13:22] <Thursday_> I like it 
[03:14:01] <Thursday_> do you think your ecosystem will one day compete with richard hearts?

[16:51:02] <naturaopals> We need to drastically lower the liquidity next time bff gets to $3,200-$3,400. Try to raise the floor.
[16:51:25] <ogwebchef888> If I have any ulterior motive is that I paired with BFF before it's run and it's helping me burn tokens due to Finvesta's 5% tax on it.
[16:51:47] <ogwebchef888> Liquidity is burned @naturaopals
[16:53:03] <naturaopals> I don’t think we are supposed to burn much liquidity at these lower price levels.

[16:54:38] <ogwebchef888> v1 BFF/No Nukes lp was sent to the Atropa token address essentially burning it
[16:58:10] <naturaopals> Yes. That helped establish a floor. If we provide liquidity at a higher price, then burn it. We should be able to raise the floor
[17:01:55] <ogwebchef888> 100%
[17:04:12] <naturaopals> We have had fairly consistent swings from $2200-$3400. Then seem to hold around $2850. It had been a few days at that level. Feels like it’s time to raise that midline value to $3100-$3200.

[17:54:05] <DunnyHex> Hey #atropa_logged
[18:25:06] <MikeFA_> Friday_: I like to invite people to read Richard’s scivive if not done allready.
[18:36:42] <candlekindle> Hey ogwebchef888 , here is a thought. If Maria were to write in donation accounts, I'm not sure if that is the optics she wants to have on a contract. Previous write-ins were reward based on what she thought was worthy contingent on factors that were important to her. If she were to do my original suggestion, then it almost look like a perpetual pre-sale for those who 'bought' in. My new thought is that you draw up a contract/coin
[18:36:42] <candlekindle> that rewards BFF to purchasers. This allows Maria to have clean hands in the situation and also helps achieve her goal stated a day or two ago of having wider distribution of BFF to more people. Don't have further suggestions of how the contract would work, if peeps who have already donated get something special or anything like that. You're the cook, so will leave that up to you/the community should y'all decide to proceed. 
[18:57:14] <ogwebchef888> I can def cook that up and deploy from the wallet that's already setup with the bot.
[18:57:53] <ogwebchef888> I think there were a few individual wallets that I can airdrop for donating.
[18:59:18] <candlekindle> Nice, hopefully they decide to just LP it up with a variety of things. Unless there is a more strategic approach on what a set group LP pairings would be? I'm far from an LP expert. 
[18:59:27] <ogwebchef888> Will aim for launch tonight depending on how much starting liquidity I can raise. I think 20m pls is a good starting point
[19:00:02] <ogwebchef888> Yeah can pair it with No Nukes as one of the initial lps
[19:00:10] <ogwebchef888> v1 for bigger arb opportunities
[19:00:46] <candlekindle> sounds good to me. Anything else?
[19:00:57] <naturaopals> Well do you think it would be best to get holders that might not understand what they are buying? Not sure if that will be a net benefit or not to the goal
[19:02:00] <DunnyHex> ogwebchef888: cool
[19:02:05] <naturaopals> It seems like people might buy that new token and sell off bff like a rewards token.
[19:03:05] <candlekindle> Sadly I think that is just the nature of the space right now. Number go up buy. Green candle buy. That's how the vast majority of people choose to buy things. If they sell it's a net 0 gain/loss as it had to purchased to be given to them. If they hold it however, then it's a net gain. 
[19:04:27] <ogwebchef888> What are @mariarahel's thoughts on this though. Will do if they think it makes sense and to keep people safe please dont ape anything that wont be deployed by 0xDD89fC734FC6E9408E2d1f6CDc1FFc7491d3249b
[19:04:47] <ogwebchef888> I've put up my own funds for the bot as well
[19:05:16] <ogwebchef888> Can perhaps allocate 2% of supply to 25 people who help with liquidity.
[19:05:31] <naturaopals> candlekindle: yes. When Maria said she was looking for more holders, I took it as wanting more people to be in on the mission of holding til $8k, then making small LPs
[19:08:22] <ogwebchef888> maybe a low liquidity stealth launch would be better. Open to thoughts
[19:08:38] <ogwebchef888> Not sure im convinced yet if this is a good move
[19:08:53] <ogwebchef888> 2% allocations is a lot
[19:09:42] <candlekindle> Correct, but if a person who buys the new ABC coin gets reward 0.000001 bff, that 0.000001 bff was purchased on-market from either their buy or someone else's sale of ABC coin. If they sell it, then they are simply erasing the buy. If they hold on to it, then they are reducing available supply of BFF, thus increasing price, which will hopefully get to the 8k which you referenced Maria stating and like you said pair it with LP. 
[19:09:42] <candlekindle> I am also 100% open to this idea not happening as well. It was just a suggestion to help increase bff buyback, and distribute bff to a wider audience should some of them hold it vs. sell it.

[19:10:43] <candlekindle> If there is a way to not have entire supply available at once, I think that would be good. We have seen what has happened when all 666 tokens get released vs. when they are sold into the open market 1 at a time for 12 hours. 
[19:11:05] <ogwebchef888> Ok will think a bit on it
[19:11:10] <ogwebchef888> We can always add a max txn
[19:11:14] <LarryHoover> I’d be willing to donate funds
[19:11:43] <naturaopals> I see positives and negatives to it. Need mariarahel to give her thoughts
[19:11:51] <ogwebchef888> Def a win to increase bff holder size alone
[19:12:01] <candlekindle> Ofc, part of the success of the selling one at a time is peeps knew it was a 414 coin and therefore felt comfortable buying whatever it was at whatever price point. A coin launched by "joe schmoe" may not receive the same welcoming buy pressure.
[19:12:17] <ogwebchef888> For sure
[19:13:19] <candlekindle> Absolutely ok with waiting to here Maria's thoughts. 
[19:13:27] <candlekindle> hear
[19:14:16] <ogwebchef888> Yeah if maria can get behind it im sure the community will as well
[19:16:12] <ogwebchef888> @LarryHoover one thing you can do is get BFF/No Nukes lp token and pair that lp token to PLS to make it tradeable
[19:16:17] <ogwebchef888> Have some ideas in mind
[19:16:28] <ogwebchef888> Can potentially make the ca reward in bff and also BFF/No Nukes LP
[19:16:45] <ogwebchef888> in order to do that though the PLP token itself needs to become tradeable

[19:39:38] <TheBanker> May I suggest something.   There should be some sort of VESTING for this rewards token if built.  Minimum 30 days.  That way BFF can actually possibly appreciate and we don't have jeets just selling off leeching off the rewards token.  If they sell before 30 days,  then they only get 50% and the other 50% gets burned :)

[20:37:07] <mariarahel> catching up on since yesterday
[20:41:04] <mariarahel> the suggestion for small wallets is literally to buy low and sell at $8k for their own profit to see how awesome we all are, the liquidity providing is only suggested for top wallets that got in at the ground level
[20:43:13] <mariarahel> og appears to have a plan fomenting but i'm not sure i fully grok the intended outcome
[20:43:44] <mariarahel> i'm focusing my thinking around this today:
[20:43:46] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJmJ5pALhaU
[20:44:24] <ogwebchef888> Yeah i'm on the fence about it. I'd be putting up my own bff and 5mil pls to get it going and it would have a max txn set so not a single wallet can buy more than 0.5%
[20:44:42] <ogwebchef888> The contract is ready though
[20:44:49] <ogwebchef888> Would reward in BFF and No Nukes

[20:48:41] <ogwebchef888> @TheBanker not sure about pre-sale but if community is fine with deployer wallet holding a set% can focus on a system like that for the ones who sent No Nukes for the bff bot cause
[20:49:08] <naturaopals> mariarahel: the thinking was to get BFF in the hands of more people. But that doesn’t encourage them to hold until $8k if bff is given as a reward.
[20:50:55] <mariarahel> thinking of conjunction secondarilly here as the set of what can be Raised and what can be Outcome
[20:51:48] <mariarahel> i feel we are solidly on target with the numbers where they are, i'd still like to get an idea of how many new users are onboarded each day
[20:52:14] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnevlCeN3HU
[20:52:20] <mariarahel> we need that
[20:53:23] <ogwebchef888> BFF has to be bought in order to be given as reward. that is incentive to hold for higher prices
[20:54:50] <mariarahel> how many of what things do we have and what are they and what are the extents of the potential effects those things can have
[20:56:32] <ogwebchef888> We have some conjunction now with first page top holders, buy bot, lp strats and a contract called ogwebchef888 that rewards in BFF and No Nukes to the holders of ogwebchef
[20:57:11] <ogwebchef888> It will increase holders and create volume on bff/no nukes
[20:57:39] <ogwebchef888> Hopefully people hold the bff rewarded and use their no nukes for any new 666 token launches.. up to the holder I guess

[21:00:31] <mariarahel> completeness is a basic fallacy of reward structures
[21:00:58] <mariarahel> for ex the reward structure of BFF is targeted complete when there is a baseline at $8k
[21:01:29] <mariarahel> and there is a quantified plan of activities that will occur at that stage to retain the target
[21:02:13] <mariarahel> the burned liquidity pools throughout the ecosystem are also complete

[21:04:58] <naturaopals> One thing I thought of is, people might not realize they are earning the bff rewards and therefore won’t sell them
[21:05:45] <mariarahel> I know exactly who Guillaume Farel was in terms of his presence in New York City at the turn of the 1900s and how he confiscated my great-grandfather's shipping line carrying 1 million poppies from libya and declared my entire family criminal

Any rewards given are given as an IOU somehow that is redeemable in 30 days.  Sorta like another project on another chain which does  up to 6 month vesting for full rewards which truly honors holders and not Jeeters.  Nobody knows the price of a token in 30 days.

[22:40:53] <Love_Atropa> is there anything about the liquidity setup of CROWS that we can learn from in order to support the stability of BFF $8k. CROWS seem to be fairly stable since the retracement. what is supporting it
[22:41:22] <mariarahel> that sounds like a good thing to analyze
[22:41:45] <mariarahel> https://scan.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeidn64pd2u525lmoipjl4nh3ooa2imd7huionjsdepdsphl5slfowy/#/token/0x203e366A1821570b2f84Ff5ae8B3BdeB48Dc4fa1?tab=holders
[22:41:49] <mariarahel> CROWS leaderboard
[22:42:09] <mariarahel> the liquidity is high at the active price level
[22:42:22] <mariarahel> therefore it is more stable
[22:42:23] <Love_Atropa> indeed
[22:43:04] <mariarahel> we don't want BFF to be stable yet though
[22:43:32] <Love_Atropa> any buy in seem to push the price up even though the buy in restrictions are not fully implemented yet....i might be wrong
[22:43:48] <mariarahel> the target of having many smaller liquidities will lend it similar stability but the action will also be significantly more dynamic
[22:44:39] <Love_Atropa> fascinating
[22:45:13] <mariarahel> having the largest liquidity on the THETA token also lends to the stability
[22:45:31] <Love_Atropa> there there...
[22:45:49] <mariarahel> the assets in beyong THETA from CROWS are not designed to decrease in value
[22:46:32] <mariarahel> I would lose control of the whole system
[22:47:12] <mariarahel> they are also designed such that i shouldn't need to monitor them or actively trade them
[22:47:59] <mariarahel> the longest term holdings will end up in that portion of the ecosystem

[22:49:04] <mariarahel> CROWS is meant to be a sort of managerial holding
[22:49:29] <mariarahel> board members holding 25 or more
[22:49:53] <mariarahel> if 35D has any suggestion it should be taken seriously
[22:50:18] <Love_Atropa> right....with CROWS i maintain my ownership of 25 and dont trade it as an experiment 
[22:50:53] <Love_Atropa> maybe it will be useful later on 
[22:51:17] <mariarahel> if you would like to expand on it as a holding position for board members then we should be open to your input
[22:51:33] <Love_Atropa> indeed
[22:52:00] <mariarahel> one other thing to note is that the initial buy in level for CROWS was at a significantly higher level than BFF, which opened on the floor
[22:52:40] <Love_Atropa> yep....noted
[22:53:22] <mariarahel> the data collection while we achieve the target will be useful in guaging the potential of similar efforts in the future
[22:53:59] <mariarahel> i still think out most valuable effort at this stage is to provide large return to small/new wallets
[22:55:04] <mariarahel> it's going to build viral advertising most
[22:56:06] <Love_Atropa> the data leading to the target seem healthy.... good participation.
[22:56:27] <mariarahel> our numbers are supportable
[22:57:14] <mariarahel> estimating we have about 100 unique investors on bff
[22:57:37] <mariarahel> currently 507 address holders
[22:58:17] <mariarahel> the number is still very very low
[22:58:57] <patrickg7818> I think the top 3 advertising greatest hits have been 1) pDAI to $1, 2) buy Teddy,  3) people discovering the interconnection of the Atropa coins and getting their minds blown
[22:59:19] <mariarahel> imagine a future launch where 8000 people are competing for first entry on the ground level and our track record has earned their trust
[23:00:10] <mariarahel> and then that number also comes to be considered not very high
[23:00:16] <mariarahel> it's rediculous
[23:01:20] <Love_Atropa> do you think community effort around BFF is  a more progressive approach to increasing holder count
[23:01:27] <Love_Atropa> once BFF stabilised at or above $8K it will be interesting to see the momentum, hopefully upwards
[23:02:08] <mariarahel> I think my approach is unique, there is no history of data to judge from

[23:04:08] <ead11> The low interest model was a great success
[23:04:36] <Love_Atropa> its refreshing to see your approach. self sustaining 
[23:04:52] <mariarahel> if we give people a reason to stay locked in to the launch plans and they are benign as possible, we should be able to get to rediculous levels

[23:05:41] <mariarahel> i think it could have gone better but it exceeded my expectations

[23:09:10] <ogwebchef888> Has max txn so can only buy max 4.4 at a time
[23:09:16] <mariarahel> pair with what ?
[23:09:27] <ogwebchef888> v2 pls
[23:09:42] <mariarahel> gotcha
[23:09:45] <mariarahel> i'm in for 1mil
[23:10:14] <ogwebchef888> I put up my own funds and burning liq I added. It will reward in BFF and No Nukes
[23:10:16] <ogwebchef888> LFG
[23:10:30] <ogwebchef888> No actual plans for airdrop yet. Let's see how holders play first
[23:10:43] <mariarahel> hearing 5mil
[23:11:03] <mariarahel> i'm in for 5mil
[23:11:10] <ogwebchef888> Kooln
[23:11:20] <ogwebchef888> Just remember can only buy 4 at a time

[23:15:46] <mariarahel> swaps keep failing
[23:16:00] <ogwebchef888> Too many buys coming in 
[23:16:06] <ogwebchef888> Oh it has 4% tax
[23:16:13] <ogwebchef888> 3.9% goes to buying BFF/No Nukes
[23:16:14] <mariarahel> 7% slippage
[23:16:29] <ogwebchef888> 0.01% sends ogwebchef888 to annabelle ca
[23:16:34] <ogwebchef888> Hmm
[23:16:40] <ogwebchef888> Too many people buying at once maybe
[23:16:44] <mariarahel> can't buy em
[23:16:55] <mariarahel> i got 3.84
[23:16:57] <ogwebchef888> Might need 49% slippage to beat the crowd
[23:17:07] <ogwebchef888> Nioce
[23:17:39] <mariarahel> i think it has been shown beyond doubt that any token that requires setting high slippage to swap is not going to do well
[23:18:00] <ogwebchef888> I almost had it reward MV as well but worried about that
[23:18:17] <ogwebchef888> Prob because of token distribution of 2 tokens
[23:18:23] <ogwebchef888> Unconventional for sure
[23:18:49] <mariarahel> i used to like them, but they all fail
[23:19:12] <ogwebchef888> Word
[23:20:15] <ogwebchef888> I'll experiment a bit more to make gas less high
[23:20:44] <ogwebchef888> I can make fees very small too
[23:21:34] <ogwebchef888> Anyone else having issues ?
[23:22:41] <Love_Atropa> i poped in 8% slippage. worked fine on wpls pair
[23:24:05] <MikeFA_> Usual settings easy swap. All fine

[23:24:31] <ogwebchef888> Pretty degen of me but I usually always have slippage at 49% LOL
[23:25:19] <Love_Atropa> hahaha 
[23:26:29] <SunnyDay> I like the concept ogwebb. It can be done, and you have done it well. Its all in the math on how long it works. Using the LP webs we can make anything reward for life
