[22:09:19] <mariarahel> Fuck Off It's The Treaty
[22:09:43] <mariarahel> You Should Already Know That The Treaty Starts With Fuck Off
[22:10:41] <_surfacing8671> the fuck off and get fucked treaty

[22:14:01] <_surfacing8671> they have a competition where there are set moves and plays on a table with no pockets and they have to try to re create the shot. its crazy 
[22:15:02] <ogwebchef888> Hey fam @_surfacing8671
[22:15:37] <ogwebchef888> For the vaults your building, what tactics are u using for data fetching in an efficient way without having to rely on main rpc?
[22:16:57] <ogwebchef888> I was thinking of setting up a way to use websocket from g4mm4.io to fetch data in parallel with wagmi/viem in multi batch calls and then storing it in a postgre db
[22:17:19] <_surfacing8671> currently it is just a public rpc but im gonna be switching over to this indexing solution my buddy has made. its much better imo then others as the syntax is more natural and is writen with viem library https://www.arkiver.net/
[22:17:32] <mariarahel> I Have A Screentest Idea
[22:17:38] <mariarahel> How Much Liberty Have We Got ?
[22:17:43] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdNOfHyk3xY
[22:17:43] <ogwebchef888> Damn thats pretty cool granted we don't have oracle 
[22:17:49] <_surfacing8671> look up indexing solutions 
[22:17:53] <_surfacing8671> you dont need one 
[22:18:11] <ogwebchef888> What about using cloudflare workers to offset rpc lag?
[22:18:22] <_surfacing8671> think of it as running a bunch of normal view calls and storing it to a db 
[22:18:24] <ogwebchef888> I think relying on rpc only is no bueno
[22:18:51] <_surfacing8671> correct. it just pulls from the database after it has indexed the chain and contract 
[22:19:16] <_surfacing8671> the graph node is a more common one but doesnt offer as much flexability on new chains 
[22:19:16] <mariarahel> Charter's Job Is Making Trademark Profitable
[22:19:26] <ogwebchef888> It will give real time data ? thinking providing real time data can be overkill and can just do polling
[22:19:55] <_surfacing8671> yes it will. it will index every block therfore needs to run on a server of its own 
[22:20:06] <mariarahel> Liberty Was Released Without Clearing Our Possession Of The Trademark Completely For All Interested Parties
[22:20:06] <ogwebchef888> Makes sense!
[22:20:41] <_surfacing8671> well we can trademark anything. it only holds any weight if actually does something 
[22:20:50] <mariarahel> Charter's Job Is To Support The Analysis Of That Trademark Possession To The Question Of Profit
[22:21:33] <mariarahel> Charter's Value To Consulting Is Entirely Greater Than Kearney's
[22:21:50] <_surfacing8671> i think that when you register it then it becomes more secured 
[22:25:07] <mariarahel> What Is Liberty ?
[22:25:30] <mariarahel> Consult Liberty
[22:25:51] <_surfacing8671> who is liberty 
[22:26:06] <mariarahel> We Have A Lot
[22:26:22] <mariarahel> More Than Charter
[22:27:24] <mariarahel> A Lot More $LIBERTYtm
[22:27:57] <mariarahel> Can We Have All Of It ?
[22:28:23] <_surfacing8671> ok ok so what is liberty then. i think liberty should be shared 
[22:28:23] <mariarahel> Stavros Is Supposed To Be Capable Of Attaining Full Possession Of $LIBERTYtm
[22:28:41] <mariarahel> Possibly Only Stavros Though
[22:28:47] <mariarahel> I Sure Am Stavros
[22:29:13] <mariarahel> You Don't Respect The Trademark Liberty Of Stavros Can Fuck Off
[22:31:24] <mariarahel> Figure Out How To Be Stavros, Everybody
[22:32:13] <mariarahel> I Have No Idea How You Can Do That If You Have Absolutely Zero Stavros In Your Culture
[22:32:46] <mariarahel> Probably I Will Never Respect You

[23:02:01] <_surfacing8671> i dont think it will know what to do with it. it could guess but that will be more like a child on crack trying everything i would imagine.
