[14:41:55] <mariarahel> i think it can be simplified with the nit added
[14:42:41] <mariarahel> if the Kappa, Rho, & Psi go into the Nit & the Nit goes into the Living
[14:43:06] <mariarahel> they will be captured as data in the nit buffer
[14:45:01] <mariarahel> it will make the model more attractive to work with from an external perspective
[14:46:09] <mariarahel> the idea of forming the connections in the current way is that it is the minimal ordered set of proofs needed to show capacity for each level of object
[14:48:59] <mariarahel> same concept as a ^ b % c
[14:49:54] <mariarahel> same concept as modular exponentiation
[14:50:14] <mariarahel> signet > module
[14:51:27] <mariarahel> if the Kappa, Rho, & Psi are captured as signet in the buffer of the Nit & the Nit goes into the Living
[14:52:23] <mariarahel> I think Nu can just come out then
[14:52:45] <mariarahel> all the same requirements are met
[14:53:53] <mariarahel> the ည class then contains only Mu, Tau, Theta, & Gamma
