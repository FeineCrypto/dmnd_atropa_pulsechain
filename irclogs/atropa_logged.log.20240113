[01:01:15] <mariarahel> placing a number of the liquidities with assets with large liquidities of their own in the yet to stabilize tokens will cause pressure
[01:02:52] <mariarahel> it's also going to depend on how many new buyers we keep coming in
[01:03:59] <mariarahel> there is a significant value if we can hold the price at $8k while accomplishing a finite plan for buyers who are willing to wait A Couple of months to see profit

[01:37:59] <dreadedhamish> @mariahrahel use $8k as a test - if community can hold instead of dumping then set a new higher target. I think a lot will dump at 8k thinking the game is over.
[01:39:16] <wndr> only your true loyal followers will be holding waiting for your next move
[01:50:23] <dreadedhamish> if you want to go higher I'd announce now, then 8k narrative can be replaced and selling won't be as bad at 8k.

[14:07:33] <mariarahel> dumping at $8k should be encouraged if that's where you want to get out, esp if you can dump without dropping the price below $8k
[14:08:24] <mariarahel> as the lower positions get out and new positions come in to set the bar at that number it will prove a stronger bottom line
[14:11:26] <mariarahel> there should be a way to blackball contract creation addresses
[14:12:41] <mariarahel> the atropa ecosystem layer 2 will have such features, if you do not like a certain peer you should be able to block everything that they do
[14:13:32] <mariarahel> if the distributed system supports it properly the peer should be blocked from pushing any data whatsoever into the shared chains
[14:14:56] <mariarahel> if they have some share of funded materials they should only be able to trade them with peers and liquidity pools that have not blocked them
[14:15:58] <mariarahel> the system could support restricted distribution funds that way where ie: the contract creation address only interracts with a single or set of peers according to fixed rules
[14:16:15] <mariarahel> dicentralization
[14:18:37] <mariarahel> dicentralization as the intrinsic feature of distribution

[14:27:47] <mariarahel> i'm not yet certain there will be gas fees
[14:28:08] <mariarahel> if high traffic hosts can block everything they don't want then they're not necessary
[14:28:35] <_surfacing8671> ok yeah duh its not like a layer one lol 
[14:29:58] <mariarahel> i'm imagining a scenario where a private contract creator might want to set up a specific proxy/firewall tunnelling system of some shape
[14:30:11] <mariarahel> and still targeting a 10 peer per server maximum for default
[14:30:45] <_surfacing8671> ok i know what your talking about. could be like an app factory in a way. 
[14:34:10] <mariarahel> i'm thinking the peering needs to be completed before any chat messaging
