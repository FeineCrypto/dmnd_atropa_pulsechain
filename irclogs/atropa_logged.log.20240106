[03:12:41] <SunnyDay> If this pair could be part of anything helpful, we are listening 0x68EF475FCBA8ee52921079e3dCe96E5aa03A4E15

[03:16:22] <mariarahel> it's a good buy in my opinion, the 5 liquidity holders with the pls pair only have 9.11 tokens all together
[03:16:42] <mariarahel> the liquidity of 217 tokens is only owned by the burn
[03:17:58] <mariarahel> i think the leaderboard on that one is a good measure of the success of the ecosystem

[15:01:41] <_surfacing8671> a noop heartbeat. does that work similar to the ping pong method? 
[15:02:11] <mariarahel> it's only a keepalive so there is no connection dropped
[15:02:39] <mariarahel> it helps to make the protocol more robust to have it in there
[15:02:54] <mariarahel> it might move or change form again later

[15:03:56] <_surfacing8671> im not very well versed on networking but does that mean that it keeps it alive by checking the connection then acting or by just saying reconnect regardless. or a close then reconnect to always assume connections.

[17:41:52] <mariarahel> $ESTABLISHMENT
[17:45:22] <mariarahel> i think maybe the Greed class should derive from Oracle
[17:45:25] <mariarahel> and not Daemon
[17:48:23] <mariarahel> maybe not
[17:49:42] <mariarahel> maybe Fi, Oracle, & Greed as a single class
[17:51:13] <mariarahel> $COMPELLING
[17:51:45] <mariarahel> You're not supposed to update compelling software you're only supposed to sell it until the customer wants more
[17:54:08] <mariarahel> either Fi & Greed are Derived from Oracle, or they only make use of Oracle & all three are derived from Daemon
[17:54:50] <mariarahel> CROWS indicate that Greed is Derived From Oracle
[17:55:23] <mariarahel> Fi would not be
[17:56:15] <mariarahel> is Greed a Daemon or an Oracle, eric ?

[20:09:10] <mariarahel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO-GJLAQvOw
[20:10:28] <mariarahel> i had a thought
[20:10:46] <mariarahel> if there are ostensibly hundreds of clients connected to the layer 2
[20:11:07] <mariarahel> and the primary initial function is chatlog
[20:11:59] <mariarahel> nicknames/handles are absolutely not gonna make the cut for common data pattern
[20:12:57] <mariarahel> i'm presuming that 99% of clients long term that might interract with the chatlog will have no nicknames or handles
[20:18:37] <mariarahel> it can be working to replace the irc very very soon if i get the mockup done so i like it
[20:18:56] <mariarahel> like within hours
[20:19:52] <mariarahel> the linux cli & windows gui will remain sync'd in available functionality, the user interfaces don't do anything but process text yet
[20:21:11] <mariarahel> there are a few options with how the first entry to the chatlog works
[20:21:59] <mariarahel> it can be global, it can be joined like a channel, or it can be accessed only via invitation/handshake
[20:22:10] <mariarahel> i think it has to be the third
[20:22:43] <mariarahel> the invitations would require 5 64-bit integers
[20:23:07] <mariarahel> with an additional handshake of 1 or 2 more 64-bit integers
[20:25:14] <mariarahel> there are a number of ways to do message signing
[20:39:16] <mariarahel> post handshake there's no way to impersonate any other connected peer
[20:39:46] <mariarahel> i think the distributed encryption model can be used rather than any form of signing
[20:40:07] <mariarahel> otherwise the central server already has the connection specific identity
[20:47:39] <mariarahel> imagining "Upsilon Blocks"
[20:53:45] <mariarahel> so once you are invited and handshake and join any channel, you have the option to create a further invitation-only encrypted channel within that one
[20:54:41] <mariarahel> and the central server maintains the only complete blockchain, any subscriber client will only be able to store a local blockchain to the degree that they are granted access
[20:55:19] <mariarahel> and if you ever hack the encryption you can steal the server origination point
[20:56:58] <mariarahel> so if you create a local encrypted channel you become the central server for that and it only goes global if you give the encryption keys out
[20:58:18] <mariarahel> later to make a broad map of connected rooms
[20:58:27] <mariarahel> but also teleportaion

[20:59:11] <mariarahel> so for a game map the room has to reset its encryption for persons still in the room every time anyone leaves
[21:01:34] <mariarahel> hosting open serializations is blockchain
[21:02:29] <mariarahel> any "token" or "currency" like data would only be spendable within a single room then

[21:09:39] <mariarahel> expiry is still the hardest thing in scope, i might be able to get all the way to mud-like rooms with the initial release
[21:10:21] <mariarahel> maybe put the qing dao in its own building
[21:12:25] <mariarahel> ai bouncer on some rooms requires you to register your name or eventually kyc
[21:14:50] <mariarahel> maybe start it off in a void room and eventually lock it and move to something better

[21:24:17] <mariarahel> i think i can use the 0x10 opcode for sharing the serialization data to distribute the blockchain

[21:58:29] <mariarahel> ya i don't see it replacing the terminal interface
[21:59:23] <mariarahel> maybe convention where the room owner always has tts voice female & everybody else in the room is always male

[23:16:50] <mariarahel> only 90 tokens left
[23:16:57] <mariarahel> #2 holder still has 66
[23:18:01] <mariarahel> $240 to buy into BFF is still a very low price in my mind
[23:19:35] <mariarahel> the goal is non-artificial price pressure
[23:20:16] <mariarahel> You Want 1

[23:21:07] <Yogi> Yikes supply is decreasing fast, people are gonna wish they had 0.5 is my bet.
[23:21:34] <mariarahel> buy 2 & plan to sell 1 as soon as you break even

[23:22:58] <mariarahel> i'm not the best person to give advice on pwning profit from the pinata
[23:23:18] <mariarahel> i just hodl 4evr and sell little at a time

[23:24:04] <mariarahel> and what contract interractions seem to make good writing
[23:24:40] <mariarahel> like i might sell down to 93 BFF by the time the chatlog is fully live in the new network
[23:25:02] <mariarahel> then maybe never sell again
[23:28:49] <mariarahel> my target price is probably around $8k
[23:29:29] <FREEDOM_777> that would be epic
[23:29:36] <mariarahel> if the liquidity is low enough it works out well..
[23:29:47] <mariarahel> i'm really not sure how it works out
[23:30:06] <mariarahel> if say price is $8k but selling even just 1 drops the price to $4k
[23:30:15] <FREEDOM_777> right
[23:30:24] <mariarahel> if no one adds liquidity it can happen
[23:30:57] <mariarahel> then later liquidity can be added with involvement to level it for the next tier
[23:32:12] <mariarahel> I wouldn't want it over $8k for now
[23:32:21] <mariarahel> $8k BFF For A Day

[23:36:25] <mariarahel> i don't have a milestone in mind yet that's worth more than $8k for one day
[23:36:58] <mariarahel> prostitute money
[23:38:30] <mariarahel> there's bound to be 80 more people out there willing to pay up to $8k for one
[23:39:19] <FREEDOM_777> I got my BFF tokens when it launched. I saw the 777 supply and thought yup I need some of that 😅
[23:39:40] <mariarahel> BFF that don't sell more than 1 per day
[23:41:11] <mariarahel> lots of people have ideas for schemes like that but rarely do we get to view them function on the record
[23:42:14] <mariarahel> 144 Holders
[23:44:01] <mariarahel> it's the best meme token for the current state of the layer 2

[23:46:09] <mariarahel> ours are scrutable
[23:46:44] <mariarahel> conjure that the lore
[23:52:43] <mariarahel> i think it would work out well to bring the liquidity very very low & then place small liquidities on a large number of tokens
[23:53:38] <mariarahel> a bunch of small burned liquidities paired with a scarce supply makes it very attractive for persons actively working on pulsechain
